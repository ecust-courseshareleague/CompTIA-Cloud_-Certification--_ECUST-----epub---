This chapter explores the nontechnical aspects of cloud service delivery in policies, procedures, and best practices. These components are critical to the efficient and effective execution of cloud solutions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_258" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>The chapter begins with the documents that define the rule sets by which users and administrators must abide, called policies, and the prescribed documented actions that will carry out the expectations of the policies, known as procedures.</p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch9lev226">Policies and Procedures</h3>
<p class="noindent">Policies and procedures are the backbone of any IT organization. While the hardware, software, and their associated configurations are the products that enable the functionality businesses desire from their IT services, it is a cloud service provider&#8217;s or cloud consumer&#8217;s policies and procedures that allow IT service implementation, maintenance, and ongoing support.</p>
<p class="indent">Policies define the rule sets by which users and cloud service administrators (CSAs) must abide, and procedures are the prescribed methodologies by which activities are carried out in the IT environment according to those defined policies.</p>
<p class="indent">While most IT professionals focus on the technical aspects of IT, a growing percentage of all IT organizations are emphasizing policy and procedure development to ensure that they get the most out of their technology investment. Policies can be used to enforce IT best practices to significantly affect not only the operational efficiency and effectiveness of the businesses they serve but to also protect the organization from risk by defining compliance expectations and ensuring adherence to industry regulation.</p>
<p class="indent">This section provides information on some key business processes that aid in managing the technology environment, making it more efficient, and planning for the future. These processes include</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Creating standard operating procedures</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Workflow</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Capacity management</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch9lev227">Standard Operating Procedures</h4>
<p class="noindent">Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are a form of knowledge management. The experience gained from one individual can be documented so that others do not need to go through the same experience, possibly involving failure, to learn from it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_259" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>SOPs help ensure that tasks are performed consistently. It is likely that you will perform routine tasks many times. The first time you perform such a task, it is best to create a SOP for future migrations. You may find along the way that you can improve the SOP here or there. Feel free to add more details to the SOP as you discover enhancements.</p>
<p class="indent">A SOP will ensure that others who perform the same task do so with the same level of professionalism that you do. SOPs also ensure consistent implementation, including the amount of time it takes to perform the task and the resources required.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch9lev228">Workflow</h4>
<p class="noindent">Workflows are business processes that are organized in sets of discrete tasks from the beginning to the end of the processes. Workflow task details include the dependencies and requirements such as the personnel, technology, tools, and environment required to complete the task.</p>
<p class="indent">Workflow modeling can help visualize a workflow by placing each task on a timeline, with dependencies shown as prerequisite tasks and parallel tasks shown about one another. Relationships are depicted using paths. Each path is a set of tasks that can be performed independently of other tasks. Some paths may diverge and then join back together to express group dependencies and then a period where tasks can be carried out at the same time. Some paths may take longer to complete than others. A project management technique known as <em>critical path analysis</em> identifies paths where there is no extra time available. When resources are scarce, tasks on the critical path should be given a higher priority.</p>
<p class="indent">Workflow can be helpful in managing standard processes, but it can be even more effective when those processes are automated. The SOPs an organization creates in the course of doing business can now be used in establishing workflow automation. Once a process has been performed several times, and it is sufficiently well documented, there may be methods of automating the process so that it is even more streamlined. The documentation will ensure that you do not miss a critical step in the workflow, and it can help in troubleshooting workflows later on. Workflow automation with runbooks is discussed in more detail in <a href="part0027.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch9lev229">Capacity Management</h4>
<p class="noindent">Capacity management is the process of ensuring that both the current and future capacity and performance demands of an IT organization&#8217;s customers regarding service provision are delivered according to justifiable costs. Capacity management has overall responsibility for ensuring that there is adequate IT capacity (as the name suggests) to meet required service levels, that the appropriate stakeholders are correctly advised on how to match capacity and demand, and that existing capacity is optimized.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_260" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Successful capacity management requires considerable attention to be paid to the design of the system. The design phase must ensure that all service levels are understood and that the capacity to fulfill them is incorporated into the design&#8217;s configuration. Once the configuration has been adequately designed and documented, operations can establish a baseline, as discussed in <a href="part0021.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7</a>. This baseline is a measuring stick against which capacity can be monitored to understand both the current demand and trend for future needs.</p>
<p class="indent">The capacity management process includes producing and maintaining an appropriate capacity plan that reflects the current and future requirements of its customers. The plan is designed to accomplish the following objectives:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Provide advice and guidance to all other areas of the business and IT on all capacity- and performance-related issues.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Ensure that service performance achievements meet or exceed all of their agreed-upon performance targets by managing the performance and capacity of both services and resources.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Ensure the current and future capacity and performance demands of the customer regarding IT service provision are delivered within justifiable costs.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Assist with the diagnosis and resolution of both performance- and capacity-related incidents and problems.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Assess the impact of any changes to the capacity plan and the performance and capacity of all IT services and resources.</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Ensure that proactive measures to improve the performance of services are implemented.</p>
<p class="indent">When building this capacity plan, its architects must factor in all IT resources, including both human and technical resources. Keep in mind that people are resources as well.</p>
<p class="text-icon"><img src="../Images/image01119.jpeg" width="58" height="40" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="text-icon1"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>There was a systems administrator who was in charge of a major corporate website back in the 1990s whose story serves as an excellent object lesson both for capacity and change management. His company had recently hired him to work on the ramp-up for a new website, and he worked closely with the marketing group to make sure his team designed the site for all the functionality to be captured in the capacity requirements. Subsequently, the marketing team decided to run an advertisement during the Super Bowl that was intended to drive users to their redesigned website. However, they failed to involve IT in the discussion. Since the expected capacity requirements had changed and IT had not been informed, the site, which had been designed for a far smaller load, crashed within seconds of the ad running. The IT department had not staffed administrators for support and monitoring during the costly advertisement, so they were unable to recover quickly. Because of this capacity planning failure, what had started out as a great marketing idea turned into a colossal marketing nightmare.<span id="page_261" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch9lev230">Systems Management Best Practices</h3>
<p class="noindent">The processes and procedures that IT organizations implement to achieve results more effectively and efficiently are the results of careful design, standardized environments, and thorough documentation.</p>
<p class="indent">With a view to building sustainable technology solutions that consistently deliver their intended value, system maintenance must be performed at every step of the application life cycle. Documentation of the business requirements for any proposed IT service additions or changes should be the first phase of the life cycle, followed by documentation for the proposed technical design, continuing into implementation planning documents and support documentation, and coming full circle in the life cycle through documented service improvement plans.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch9lev231">Documentation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Documentation is an important part of systems management. Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a collection of best practices for IT service management. It was put together initially by the British government but was spun off under a private best practices body called AXELOS in 2013. ITIL is one of the most widely used IT service management best practices in the world and it is very helpful in understanding best practice in IT documentation. ITIL is divided into five publications called volumes that cover the following categories:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Service strategy</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Service design</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Service transition</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Service operation</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Continual service improvement</p>
<p class="indent">ITIL provides a framework for documentation for each of the five sections and this section will discuss documentation in that context.</p>
<p class="indent">During the service strategy phase of ITIL, business requirements are documented as the entry point for all IT services. The key piece of documentation in this stage is the service portfolio. The service portfolio is a full list of quantified services that will enable the business to achieve a positive return on its investment in the service.</p>
<p class="indent">During the service design phase, technical solutions, support processes, and service level agreements (SLAs) are documented in the service design package (SDP). The SDP includes <span id="page_262" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>the technical solutions, such as routers, switches, servers, and storage, support processes for maintaining the service, and SLAs with the customer as to the mutually agreed-upon levels of capacity, availability, and performance.</p>
<p class="indent">The service transition phase is focused on delivering the SDP and all of its detail into a living, breathing operational environment. This documentation stage consists of change and configuration documentation. See <a href="part0027.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a> for more details on change and configuration management.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, a service improvement register documents opportunities for improving IT services as follows:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Opportunities are categorized as short-term, medium-term, or long-term options.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Opportunities are assessed as part of the service strategy phase once the life cycle restarts.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Opportunities are assigned a business value that can be weighed against implementation cost.</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Opportunity time frames, value, and costs are evaluated to determine which services to add or modify to provide the greatest value to customers.</p>

<hr class="hr-si1" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/>
<p class="indent">Documentation is one vehicle that drives effective systems administration, as it allows CSAs to expand their ability to comprehend very complex environments without having to keep all the information in their heads. Another very effective way to accomplish this goal is through standardization.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch9lev232">Standardization</h4>
<p class="noindent">Standardization reduces the complexities of system administration because CSAs only need to learn the standard way of doing things, since that method and configuration is applicable across many systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Standardization focuses on two areas: procedures and configurations. Standard procedures were discussed earlier in the &#8220;Standard Operating Procedures&#8221; section. Now we will focus on standardizing configuration. Some of the advantages of standardization include</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Systems management is performed consistently.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;System access is better controlled.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;System communication protocols are the same across applications and services.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Uniform system logging and auditing settings are employed.</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Systems are deployed in the same manner each time.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_263" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Standardization allows for systems to be managed consistently in the same way. Organizations can specify which management protocols to use and whether centralized management utilities will be put in place. When new systems are evaluated, the selection group then ensures that new software or cloud services meet the standard requirements so that they can be managed in the same way. Consistent management reduces the amount of time spent managing devices and makes employees more efficient as they get more comfortable with the process. Consistent management means that administrators need to be familiar with fewer tools, so training administrators is easier and the company spends less on licensing because fewer tools need to be licensed.</p>
<p class="indent">Standardization mandates who has access by default. Some devices come with default configurations that may not be secure or in the company&#8217;s best interests. Standards define which users have administrative access and which users should have functional access to newly deployed systems. This ensure that end users do not have access to systems until the systems have been fully provisioned and tested for use.</p>
<p class="indent">Standardization is used to enforce how systems communicate with one another. Using standard communication models allows the organization to specify fewer traffic rules on intermediary devices. This decreases the complexity of management and decreases the attack surface of systems and networks since only a small set of authorized communication protocols is allowed through. Communication standardization also makes it easier to detect unauthorized communication attempts if such attempts utilize a nonstandard communication method.</p>
<p class="indent">Standardization ensures consistent system logging and auditing settings are applied to servers, computers, and network devices so that accurate data is retained. Some logging settings such as file access logging or the logging of both successes and failures may not be configured everywhere, but having such information can be very useful when there are questions about what happened on a device. Standard logging methods ensure that each device will have the information the organization needs to make decisions or to remediate an incident. Furthermore, the organization will have a more complete picture because each device will be recording the same types of information.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, standardization can help confirm that systems are deployed the same way each time. This is especially important as continuous improvement and continuous delivery models produce more frequent software deployments. Each deployment should go through the same standard steps so that it is deployed correctly and efficiently.</p>
<p class="indent">Organizations often specify their own standards for how systems must be configured, but these standards may be based on industry standards such as the following:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27000 series</p>

<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch9lev233"><span id="page_264" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Metrics</h4>
<p class="noindent">Metrics are an excellent way to track company performance. Metrics can be defined for all sorts of indicators. Another name for metrics is key performance indicators (KPIs). Metrics should be defined for items that are essential for organizational success. Some companies establish parameters because someone else is using them, but unless the metric contributes to the company&#8217;s goals and mission, it is more likely a waste of time.</p>
<p class="indent">Metrics fall under the role of operations, and cloud operations (or &#8220;ops&#8221;) teams often identify and track cloud-based metrics. As you can tell from the name, ops teams are part of DevOps, introduced in <a href="part0021.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Cloud environments can be quite complex, with many different cloud solutions integrated into a hybrid multi-cloud. Metrics can help the cloud operations team and management track how systems are performing and the efficiency of processes.</p>
<p class="indent">Metrics are essential in evaluating whether service level agreements are being met and in demonstrating to customers how the provider is achieving service level agreements. Metrics also help in identifying problems.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Chargeback/Showback Models</h4>
<p class="noindent">IT is often seen as purely an organizational cost to be reduced. IT often has to defend its actions and budget. Showbacks track usage of IT services so that management can see the value of IT services in relation to their costs. This makes budgeting much easier. Also, when cutbacks are needed, management will have the data necessary to reduce services that have the least organizational impact.</p>
<p class="indent">IT can also push the costs of technology services onto the company departments that use those services through chargebacks. Chargebacks track usage of systems by departments or individuals and then bill the department for the utilization of the service. Chargebacks are popular in consulting organizations, law firms, accounting firms, and others that bill services to clients, because costs such as printing, faxing, and cloud service usage can be charged back to their clients as a cost of providing the service.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>Reporting Based on Company Policies</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Company policies specify the expectations the company has for employee behavior and how systems should operate. These items are of obvious importance to the organization because leaders took the time to write these expectations out in policy and made employees aware of the policy requirements. For this reason, policy elements can be a good guide for identifying metrics to track. As an example, if the company policy says that high vulnerabilities must be remediated within seven days, it would make sense to establish a vulnerability remediation metric to track how long it takes to remediate vulnerabilities, including high vulnerabilities.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span id="page_265" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><span class="bign"><strong>Reporting Based on SLAs</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;A service level agreement (SLA) is a contract that specifies the level of uptime that will be supported by the service provider. SLAs include provisions for how the service provider will compensate customers if SLAs are not met, so it is in the organization&#8217;s best interest to ensure that SLAs are met.</p>
<p class="indent">Metrics can be defined to measure SLA performance. For example, if the SLA states that an application must be available 99.999 percent of the time, an important metric to track would be site availability.</p>

<h4 class="h4">Dashboards and Reporting</h4>
<p class="noindent">Gathering metrics is important, but they become useful when they are made available for decision-making and performance monitoring. Dashboards and reporting are two methods commonly used to make metrics available to those who need them. Dashboard panels, often consisting of a web portal or a linked spreadsheet, contain a series of metrics on specific areas. Web portals can be viewed anywhere, so they are available when needed. Spreadsheets are similarly shared, if not quite as easy to use as a web dashboard. One downside with spreadsheets is that they will not update if the resources from which they obtain their data are inaccessible, making the spreadsheet data stale. Stale spreadsheets can happen if the spreadsheet is created by someone who is authorized to collect the data and then later shared with another who is not. For this reason, web portals are far superior to spreadsheets for tracking metrics.</p>
<p class="indent">Metrics can also be tracked with reports that are set out at periodic intervals. This is typically an automated procedure, but upper-management reports are often consolidated from other reports and prepared by hand to give them additional polish. Applications can be configured to e-mail out reports with selected metrics on performance at certain intervals. Of course, this requires that data regarding these metrics is available to the application.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>System Availability</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;System availability metrics are a core metric of any service provider, including cloud service providers (CSPs). Customers are purchasing an IT service, and it is important for them to know when and how often that service is unavailable through such metrics as system uptime, bandwidth, or error rate. Some services can ping websites and send out notifications if a site becomes unavailable. These sites also track availability percentages and provide dashboards for viewing all checks.</p>
<p class="indent">It is also possible to collect availability metrics on the underlying components that make up a system, such as web services, database services, file systems, critical service dependencies, <span id="page_266" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>and so forth. Notifications can be similarly configured for such systems, with dashboards for viewing the status of all essential functions in one place.</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Uptime</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;Uptime can be a differentiating factor for service providers if uptime numbers are particularly high. Uptime is often measured as a percentage and described in terms of how many consecutive &#8220;nines&#8221; are in the percent. For example, a system that provides 99.999 percent availability is offering five nines of availability while a system that provides 99.999999 percent availability is offering eight nines. A service provider can conduct a competitive analysis to reveal what competing service providers are offering for uptime availability metrics so that it can be sure to meet or exceed those numbers.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Downtime</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;Periods of unavailability are called downtime, and most cloud service providers want to minimize this because disruptions for customers mean that they are finding less value in the service offering. The number of nines was used to demonstrate uptime, but downtime is represented either as the inverse percentage or as a specific amount of time the systems were unavailable. For example, the downtime number for five nines would be 0.001 percent and the number for eight nines would be 0.000001 percent. If we were to measure these in the actual amount of time the systems were unavailable, five nines would equate to 5.39 minutes of downtime in a year while eight nines would be less than 1 second of downtime.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Connectivity</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Connectivity metrics measure things like bandwidth consumption, congestion, and packet loss. Connectivity metrics are essential for ensuring responsive services and applications and in avoiding performance or availability problems.</p>
<p class="indent">Track connectivity metrics to ensure that communication mediums do not get congested. By tracking connectivity metrics, a service provider can expand bandwidth or implement throttling to control available resources. Cloud dashboards can quickly show if, for example, a select group of virtual desktop users are utilizing more bandwidth than others. The cloud administrator may decide to implement throttling on those users if the cloud account as a whole is approaching a bandwidth limit or they may decide to upgrade to a plan that includes more bandwidth if the bandwidth consuming activity is for legitimate business purposes. Connectivity metrics are also useful to conducting trending on connectivity metrics to determine when upgrades will be necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">Connectivity dashboards can show connectivity parameters for links within the network and across sites. Some system tools for collecting network connectivity data include PRTG Network Monitor and SolarWinds NetFlow Traffic Analyzer. You can use SNMP and RMON to collect device statistics. Some companies perform protocol analysis as well to gain additional insight into connectivity.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Latency</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Latency metrics measure site, service, or link response time. Latency metrics are essential for ensuring responsive services and applications and in avoiding performance or availability problems.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_267" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Track latency metrics to ensure that services are meeting established SLAs and that end users are receiving data from devices with the lowest latency. Implement changes or add local services when regions are not well served. It is important to monitor latency metrics in replication, especially synchronous replication, to avoid performance issues.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Capacity</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Capacity metrics measure how much storage is allocated, used, and free. Capacity metrics are useful in ensuring that enough storage is available to users and applications. Track capacity metrics to ensure that volumes do not get full, and expand volumes or add storage as needed. You should also consider conducting trending on capacity metrics to determine when upgrades will be necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">Storage vendors produce dashboards and tools for viewing capacity metrics. These can sometimes be integrated into other reporting suites with Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) or through custom vendor integration tools or APIs.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>Overall Utilization</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Detailed metrics are great for solving problems and for reporting, but it helps to have an overall picture of usage across the board. Overall utilization metrics can be obtained by consolidating individual metrics to give decision makers and operations teams valuable insight on current usage and trends and can enable forecasting of future needs and opportunities.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Cost</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Cost is a fundamental metric in any scenario. IT costs can be a significant portion of a company&#8217;s budget, so it is important for those managing IT to know where money is being spent and how those costs are contributing to business operations. In a cloud-based environment, billing is often based on consumption, so IT needs to be able to show with metrics how that consumption is contributing to IT costs.</p>
<p class="indent">Cost metrics will also need to be calculated for chargebacks and showbacks to show which clients or departments are to be billed for IT services as part of a chargeback initiative or just to track consumption for showbacks.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>Incidents</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Incidents can and will happen in your organization. It is important to have an incident response plan and to specify metrics on how long certain tasks will take. Notification periods for investigations are very strict, and there will be a lot of pressure during the incident to meet those deadlines. Be familiar with these metrics before the incident. Some metrics include investigation time, detection time, number of records affected, number of users affected, remediation cost, remediation hours, and investigation hours.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>Health</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Health metrics are valuable to gauge when equipment replacement is likely. Some CSAs may choose to replace equipment proactively in particularly critical environments. <span id="page_268" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Health metrics also provide information useful for determining which spare equipment should be purchased for expected substitutes. Some important hardware health metrics include</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Mean time between failures (MTBF)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Mean time to repair (MTTR)</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Self-monitoring, analysis, and reporting technology (SMART)</p>
<p class="indent">MTBF is the average time a device will function before it fails. MTBF can be used to determine approximately how long a hard drive will last in a server.</p>
<p class="indent">MTTR, on the other hand, is the average time that it takes to repair a failed hardware component. MTTR is often part of the maintenance contract for virtualization hosts. An MTTR of 24 hours or less would be appropriate for a higher-priority server, whereas a lower-priority server might have an MTTR of seven days.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, SMART is a set of hard disk metrics that are used to predict failures by monitoring over 100 metrics such as read error rate, spin-up time, start and stop count, reallocated sectors count, and seek error rate. SMART has predefined thresholds for each metric, and those thresholds are used to determine if a drive is in an OK, warning, or error status.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Elasticity</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Elasticity is a measurement of how sensitive one variable is to changes in another. Elasticity is important in tracking metrics because some metrics may be dependent upon one another or may have an impact on one another. Elasticity can track how changes in one metric affect other metrics.</p>
<p class="indent">Elasticity cause and effect, in turn, can be used to focus better efforts to improve performance. For example, a company may find that several key performance metrics improve when training time is increased. From a more technical perspective, backup time metrics may improve if bandwidth utilization is reduced.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch9lev234">Planning</h4>
<p class="noindent">Once the baseline states are documented, agreed upon in writing, and put in place, what happens when maintenance needs to occur, or system upgrades take place? Such events almost certainly disrupt a baseline. These events must be planned for under controlled circumstances by the systems administrator, and cannot happen at random times without the consent of the customer. Maintenance windows need to be established as part of any IT environment for all of its configuration items. These windows should be scheduled at periods of least potential disruption to the customer, and the customer should be involved in the maintenance-scheduling process. After all, the customer knows their patterns of business activity better than the systems administrators ever could.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_269" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>All technology upgrades and patches should utilize these maintenance windows whenever possible, and the timing of their implementation should always be reviewed as part of the standard change management process by the change advisory board (CAB). Change management is discussed in <a href="part0027.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch9lev235">Systems Maintenance</h3>
<p class="noindent">IT systems require regular maintenance to help them remain free from errors and bugs, and to keep up with the latest technologies and processes. Maintenance and development updates can consume a great deal of IT personnel time, and yet their functions are core to the business. Additionally, there are some functions that overlap and others that benefit from increased integration, so a blended group of software developers and IT operations has evolved called DevOps to handle both objectives. DevOps was introduced back in <a href="part0021.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7</a> and system maintenance is also a function of the DevOps team. This section covers the following important systems maintenance activities:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Code updates</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Patch management</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Maintenance automation</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch9lev236">Code Updates</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is usually a queue of code updates, including requests, bugs, and features, that DevOps teams try to tackle. Teams may be working on different branches of code. Each branch is a portion of the program that is duplicated so that teams can work in parallel.</p>
<p class="indent">Two concepts that are often discussed within DevOps are continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). Continuous integration involves automating the elements of the coding and testing processes. CI automates testing routines so that each time a new piece of code is committed, it is subjected to testing to ensure that it meets quality standards. Other testing still needs to be performed but this function helps to catch the most routine issues early on in the development cycle with less effort.</p>
<p class="indent">Continuous delivery is a process that creates a pipeline of tasks leading toward deployment of regular software releases. In CD, DevOps teams make regular iterative changes to the code rather than working on a large portion of the program for a long period of time. This decreases the time from the introduction of new code to the deployment of that code in production. CD also allows for users of software to have more current versions and for stable releases to be produced in a short time frame. CD is also known as continuous development.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_270" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Some DevOps teams operate on short-term release schedules called <em>sprints</em> to accomplish some shared objective. Sprints allow developers to work as a team and celebrate the small successes rather than working on a huge project and only seeing the reward at the end.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Code Repository</h4>
<p class="noindent">Keeping track of changes in the code is essential. As the complexity of code increases, changes may cause unintended behavior that may not be caught until testing. For this reason, DevOps teams will keep a code repository. Code repositories can organize code branches to keep code consistent even when multiple teams are working on the same areas in parallel.</p>
<p class="indent">Developers publish code changes, or <em>commits</em>, to the repository, where a record is kept of the code that has been updated since the previous submission. Developers tag commits with a short statement on what the change accomplished. Developers can synchronize their local development environments with the code repository to receive new updates to the code or select or create branches of the code to work from. Furthermore, through the code repository, developers can easily revert to previous versions of code that they or others worked on.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Version Updates</h4>
<p class="noindent">Updating versions on end-user machines can be a big job. Three methods are used to complete version updates:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Manual version updates</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;Manual version updates require the most time from the DevOps team. Companies that use this method send teams out to update end-user machines.</p>
<p class="bullno"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Distributed environments may not be connected enough for end-user updating or package managers, so updates are sent to local staff at branch or regional offices who update applications for the users in their location. Some companies use this method to customize the application for certain regions or languages. For example, an accounting firm may deploy different versions of its application to offices in different states or countries so that those users receive an interface that is most compatible with their tax codes and processes.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>End-user updating</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;In the end-user updating method, new versions are pushed to an update server. The team then notifies end users that a new update is available. Notifications can be sent through email or by posting to a company message board or intranet. Users are expected to keep their applications updated to the latest version, and in some cases, the program may not work if it is not running the latest version.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<span id="page_271" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><strong>Package manager</strong> The third option is to use a package manager to deploy updates. The package manager resides on each end-user machine. New versions are released to a server and the package manager checks for an update on the server when the user loads the program. If a new version exists, the package manager automatically pulls down any new code to bring the application to the current version.</p>
<p class="bullno"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Package managers can also check for the local language settings on the operating system and region so that the appropriate software modules are loaded into their application.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Rollback</h4>
<p class="noindent">Developers used to save copies of an entire program or of specific modules, functions, or subroutines each time a milestone was reached. If the next set of changes broke the program and the solution was not apparent, it was easiest to replace the existing code with the last backup rather than try to find all the changes and remove them.</p>
<p class="indent">Code repositories make rollback much simpler. In fact, are now standard practice. If developers detect an error in testing and cannot find the cause, the code can be rolled back to a previous version by selecting the commit from the repository and deploying it back to the development environment. The code repository only stores the changes, so it takes much less space to store and less time to roll back.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Deployment Methodologies</h4>
<p class="noindent">Recall from the discussion of the application life cycle in <a href="part0021.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7</a> that deployment is the fourth phase of the application life cycle. For review, the phases are specifications, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. In the deployment phase, the application is installed and configured for use and procedures are documented for how the system should be employed. Users are then trained on how to use the system, and the application starts performing the job it was designed for.</p>
<p class="indent">DevOps will need to provision the resources required for the application, such as compute, memory, and storage resources. Deployments do not happen in a day, but methodologies such as the ones mentioned in the following sections aim to keep deployments moving along on a regular schedule of releases. Some deployment methods include the following:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Deployment landscapes</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;Releases go through development, QA, and production landscapes as they make their way from code sections to a functional release.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Rolling updates</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;A methodology that can be used to keep an application at a stable release, with another one always in the queue to be deployed shortly thereafter.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Blue-green deployment</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;These deployments always have an active system and one that is used for testing. When testing is complete, the testing system becomes active and the former production system is available for testing. One system is labeled &#8220;blue&#8221; and the other &#8220;green.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<span id="page_272" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><strong>Rapid deployment</strong> Virtualization and containerization technologies are used to create new application environments faster than ever before.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Failover clusters</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;Deployment can be performed to more than one server that work together to provide the service. Failover cluster deployments may use some of the same techniques as other deployments but they are given their own section because the implementation of that deployment methodology may differ for a clustered environment.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Landscapes</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Deployments are typically rolled out in three landscapes: development, quality assurance (QA), and production. The landscapes can be available to different teams that are responsible for specialized areas of development. As code is more refined, it moves to a different landscape and undergoes additional testing.</p>
<p class="indent">Landscapes are efficient because the simplest and most automated testing is performed to small code segments first. Since this testing is routine, it can be automated. Furthermore, the findings from those tests can be quickly resolved because the developer is very familiar with the code he or she just wrote. Later efforts can then focus on more complex testing. Second, landscapes provide higher levels of assurance as the testing environment moves closer to that of production. Landscapes also provide some isolation and separation of duties so that the people testing the product are not influenced by those writing the code.</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Development</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;The first landscape is a development environment where developers can test small changes to make sure that their code changes are providing the correct results for any new features. This provides an environment where new features and changes can be previewed without committing. Testing at this phase is largely automated.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Quality assurance (QA)</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;Once a group of small changes reaches the point where it can be packaged together into a functioning element of the specifications, it is ready to move to the QA landscape, also known as the staging landscape. The QA landscape is where software testers evaluate both the added code and the impact those changes could have on other parts of the application.</p>
<p class="bullno"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The application is tested as a whole in the QA landscape to ensure potential unintended actions, memory leaks, or security vulnerabilities do not occur. QA testing evaluates the edge cases to make sure that the application will not process data that is not within the bounds of the program. Testers will work from multiple defined use cases of the program and seek to break it by performing actions the developers might not have anticipated.</p>
<p class="bullno"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In addition to regular QA testers, the QA landscape sometimes includes select individuals from the specifications phase (the first phase of the application life cycle) to ensure that the specifications were correctly translated into an application. The product must be thoroughly tested in the QA landscape before heading to the next landscape. The lead QA tester will usually sign off on code in QA before it is moved.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<span id="page_273" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><strong>Production</strong> In the production landscape, code is placed into production where it is available for end users. Companies will usually implement a segregation of duties in this landscape so that the same person who can deploy to the QA landscape cannot deploy to the production landscape and vice versa. These are usually separate individuals from those doing the testing as well.</p>
<p class="bullno"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The production landscape is where the maintenance and support start. Any updates have to go through the other two landscapes first to make sure that the best quality product is delivered. If there are any changes to the production environment in the future, then the end users must be contacted and notified of any potential downtime that may occur.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Rolling Updates</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Traditionally, software development is done in individual release versions. However, implementing continuous integration (CI) and continuous development (CD) is quickly becoming the norm as DevOps teams work through queues of requests, bugs, and features.</p>
<p class="indent">Legacy release schedules have too much overhead associated with them to meet such expectations without increasing costs exponentially. Instead of having release versions that take a long time to deploy and test, developers work off increasingly smaller code segments so that issues are identified sooner, and testing is simpler.</p>
<p class="indent">DevOps teams do not write code from different versions. Instead, they work with a single codebase using branching to differentiate project elements and development work product from one another. Updates to the software are rolled out as releases, which are normally very small and happen frequently. A single codebase ensures that only one version of the software needs to be supported at a time.</p>
<p class="indent">With rolling updates, the program is never really finished. The application is always at a stable release, but DevOps teams have another one in the queue with regular deployment dates.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Blue-Green Deployment</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Blue-green deployment is an excellent method for DevOps teams to test changes to systems when releases are made rapidly or as part of a continuous delivery model. However, blue-green deployment is not limited to such either. Blue-green deployment uses two environments, one called blue and the other called green. One of the environments faces the customer while the other is used for testing.</p>
<p class="indent">When QA teams complete testing for a new release, the two environments are swapped. For example, the blue environment is operating for production and the green for test. A new release is deployed to green and tested. When testing is complete, the DevOps team makes green production and blue becomes the new test environment.</p>
<p class="indent">Blue-green deployment is faster than deploying from test to production since the testing environment becomes production. Swapping rather than redeploying eliminates one step in the deployment process. Additionally, blue-green environments allow for a rapid rollback if necessary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_274" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Blue-green switches are performed to make one environment online and available to customers and the other available to test. Blue-green switches can be implemented on cloud virtualization in a number of ways. Two ways outlined here involve virtual network swapping and resource group swapping.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, a CSP may host several virtual machines. These virtual machines are part of either the blue or green network depending on which virtual network they are assigned to. One set of systems may have its virtual network interface cards (NICs) on the blue virtual switch while the other set has its virtual NIC configured for the green virtual switch, where blue is production and green is test. CSAs swap the virtual switch to physical switch mapping on the hypervisor when they want to switch from blue to green or vice versa. Depending on the cloud platform, the actual switch may need to be performed by the CSP based on a request from the cloud consumer.</p>
<p class="indent">Another option is to use resource group swapping. In Microsoft Azure, resources can be deployed into groups, one for the green environment and one for the blue environment. The cloud servers in the resource group are all given private IP addresses, and an application gateway is configured with the outside IP address. The application gateway is then used to direct traffic to whichever environment is the current production. The CSP can redirect the application gateway to the other environment when it&#8217;s time to swap.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>Rapid Deployment</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Rapid deployment is a way for DevOps teams to provision and release solutions with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Rapid deployment is enabled by enhanced virtualization and container technologies such as virtual machine clones, parent-child relationships, application containerization, virtual machine templates, self-service portals, and orchestration tools that allow IT organizations to roll out systems faster than ever before.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Failover Clusters</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;A failover cluster is multiple systems configured to operate together to offer a set of services. If one system in the cluster fails, the others are configured to pick up the load of the failed server without a loss of availability to the application.</p>
<p class="indent">To deploy a failover cluster, first provision several machines. You will need at least two to form a cluster. Next, provision shared storage to all servers. Shared storage is storage from a storage array over a storage area network (SAN) such as iSCSI, Fibre Channel, or InfiniBand. Configure storage adapters in the machines such as host bus adapters (HBAs), converged network adapters (CNAs), or NICs. If using NICs for iSCSI, it is best to use ones that have TCP offload to reduce the processing burden on the CPU for storage traffic. Put the WWNs for each of the cluster members (or IP addresses of the iSCSI adapters if using iSCSI) into a host group on the storage array and then enable the storage group for concurrent access. Lastly, assign LUNs to the storage group. The storage should now be visible on each device. However, do not configure the storage yet.</p>
<p class="indent">Install the clustering features on each node in the cluster. The installation will set up some basic cluster resources off the bat, such as a quorum, the service that monitors if enough devices are connected to the cluster to be able to offer services. Configure each of the LUNs <span id="page_275" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>as a resource in the cluster and give the storage resources a name that makes sense. For example, database components like to have dedicated storage resources for different types of I/O. Typically, databases will have drives for the following types of data: tables, log files, indexes, full-text catalogs, temporary data, and backups. The storage requirements for each of these is different based on the reads and writes expected of the storage resource.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, install application services on the nodes and add services to the cluster. Set dependencies on the services so that the cluster will know in what order to start the services. Assign credentials to run the services and test the credentials on each node.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, start the application and ensure that it runs. Then test failing over elements from one node to another. Ensure that each one can be successfully failed over to each node in the cluster.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch9lev237">Patch Management</h4>
<p class="noindent">Software vendors regularly release patches for their software. Patches are software packages that modify existing software. Patches are created to fix software bugs or discovered vulnerabilities, or to add new features.</p>
<p class="indent">Patches must be deployed to organizational systems to protect against new vulnerabilities in the software that could be exploited by attackers or to fix bugs in the software that could cause problems for users. The strategy employed to deploy patches is known as patch management.</p>
<p class="indent">Some software vendors release patches on a set schedule. For example, Microsoft releases patches on the second and fourth Tuesdays of every month. Other vendors release patches as needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Companies issue patch rollups to address the issue of updating a new installation of a software application that has been around for a while. Rollups combine multiple patches in the same category, such as security, or a specific product component, into a single package that can be deployed more easily. Without rollups, customers would need to deploy a long list of updates in sequence.</p>
<p class="indent">Another type of rollup that combines even more patches is called a service pack. Companies package all patches from the last main software release or patches from the last service pack into a single update package called a service pack.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Hotfixes</h4>
<p class="noindent">Hotfixes or quick fix engineering (QFE) updates are small patches that address a specific issue. Many vendors use hotfixes to address urgent issues such as a critical vulnerability or a bug that the company cannot wait to address in its normal patching schedule.</p>
<p class="indent">Some hotfixes released by Microsoft address an issue that only some customers may face. Microsoft issues a knowledge base article to describe the issue and then customers can request the hotfix if they encounter the problem. Other customers need not apply the hotfix. This approach is usually taken when the hotfix has the potential of disrupting other systems, so it is only applied when the need to resolve the issue outweighs the <span id="page_276" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>potential drawbacks. Be aware of the drawbacks by reading the knowledge base associated with the hotfix carefully before applying the hotfix.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Patching Order of Operations</h4>
<p class="noindent">Patches are designed to be applied cumulatively, and they usually come with a version number and sometimes a build ID or other identifier that can show which patch level you are at. If you go to the About section in your software application, you can see which version you are running to identify if you need patches. <a href="part0023.xhtml#ch9fig1">Figure 9-1</a> shows the About screen from LibreOffice 5. As you can see, this system is running version 5.3.4.2, and the build ID is provided for querying for updates.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch9fig1"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 9-1</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;About screen for LibreOffice 5 showing the version number</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01176.jpeg" width="575" height="402" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="indent">Service packs are usually numbered so that customers know which service pack to apply first. For example, a customer purchases an application that has been on the market for several years. After installing the software, the customer checks for updates and find 3 service packs and 22 patches. The service packs would be named service pack 1, service pack 2, and service pack 3 and the customer would install them in that order.</p>
<p class="indent">Newly released patches are designed to be deployed to applications running the latest service pack, so a customer would need to install service packs first and then the most recent patches. In the example, the customer would install service packs 1, 2, and 3 and then install the 22 patches in sequence.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Dependency Considerations</h4>
<p class="noindent">Patches have dependencies. Cumulative updates, of course, are dependent upon previous patches. Other patch dependencies include specific software modules or features that may or may not have been installed when the program was deployed to the machine. Attempting to deploy a patch to a system where the dependencies are not present will result in an error. <span id="page_277" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>If you receive an error, double-check to ensure that you have the required dependencies. You may find that you do not need to install the patch, because you do not have the component addressed in the update.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Component Updates</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are some differences in updating different system components such as virtual machines, virtual appliances, hypervisors, networking equipment, storage, and clusters. A well-rounded IT professional needs to understand how to update each of these components.</p>
<p class="indent">Cloud services allow for some or many of the components to be managed by the CSP. This can reduce the time organizations spend on normal maintenance. For example, Amazon Web Service Relational Database Service (AWS RDS) hosts a database for use with applications or websites. The cloud consumer does not need to maintain the underlying server, operating system, database software, and networking. Instead, they can focus their efforts on the database housed within AWS RDS.</p>
<p class="indent">In an another example, hosted options running software such as cPanel allow cloud consumers to deploy databases to a MySQL instance and then access them from cloud servers or websites. Some basic maintenance tasks, such as resetting the database administrator password or changing backup schedules and restores, can be performed by the cloud consumer, but the remaining maintenance is performed by the CSP.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Virtual Machines</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Virtual machines can be updated independently using the same tools as a physical machine, but you also have some additional options. Some hypervisors can deploy updates to virtual machines. For example, vSphere Update Manager can deploy updates to virtual machines that reside on hypervisors managed by vSphere.</p>
<p class="indent">Here is the high-level procedure for automating the update process for the virtual machines:</p>
<p class="numpt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Configure repositories for where Update Manager can find updates. Repositories are indexed sources for updates.</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Create a baseline consisting of patches, service packs, upgrades, and hotfixes.</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Schedule synchronization with repositories so that Update Manager is aware of new patches, hotfixes, upgrades, and service packs.</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Assign virtual machines to a baseline.</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scan virtual machines against the baseline to determine which patches need to be applied.</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>6.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stage the patches by having Update Manager download the updates to vSphere for deployment.</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>7.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Deploy patches to the virtual machines.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Virtual Appliances</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Appliances are fully built and functional virtual machines that are purchased or downloaded from a vendor to perform a specific task. Prior to the age of virtualization, appliances would be rebranded servers or small rack-mount equipment that <span id="page_278" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>would be purchased from a vendor to perform a task. Some vendors still offer physical equipment, but this is largely a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="indent">The advantage of using an appliance versus installing and configuring the software on a server is that the appliance is set up and mostly configured by the vendor. The company is provided with a ready-to-deploy virtual machine, which saves the organization valuable deployment time.</p>
<p class="indent">Some virtual appliances are available for free from open source groups. Vendors may offer stripped-down appliances at no cost, or they may provide a fully functional unit to educational or nonprofit groups. If you purchase a virtual appliance or get it for free, you can download it from the vendor site as a virtual hard drive. Simply copy the virtual hard drive to your hypervisor, assign it resources, and start it up.</p>
<p class="indent">Virtual appliances will walk you through a configuration wizard to get the product up and running. When it comes time to update the virtual appliance, the vendor will package underlying updates together with its own software updates so that you can receive all updates in one vendor package. You can configure the appliance to download updates from the vendor and deploy them on a scheduled basis. Updates from the vendor have already been tested on the virtual machine, so there is a high likelihood that they will be deployed without issue.</p>
<p class="indent">Public CSPs, and in some cases private clouds, often have a marketplace where virtual machine templates and appliances can be selected to deploy new virtual machines in the cloud rapidly. These systems have already been confirmed to be compatible with the underlying cloud infrastructure and they can be offered cost effectively because of the CSP&#8217;s economies of scale. Research options for your CSP because some offer many different solutions while others, usually small providers, may only offer one or two solutions. The options available to you may not be the ones ideal for your workload.</p>
<p class="indent">Firewall, intrusion detection system (IDS), and intrusion prevention system (IPS) virtual appliances are covered in the &#8220;Network Security&#8221; section of <a href="part0024.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Hypervisors</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Patching hypervisors will likely result in downtime to the virtual machines that reside on it unless the hypervisor is part of a cluster. You update a hypervisor in much the same way as you would a normal computer, but any updates that require a restart or updates to hypervisor services will make the virtual machines go into a saved state or shut down.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Networking Components</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Devices such as firewalls, routers, switches, and Internet of things (IoT) equipment have updates called firmware that can be downloaded from the manufacturer. Firmware updates are usually installed manually, but some vendors such as Cisco release tools that can update a multitude of systems simultaneously or in sequence. Check with the vendor of your equipment to find out which deployment options you have. It also helps to subscribe to the vendor&#8217;s mailing list for firmware updates so that you can be notified as soon as they are released.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span id="page_279" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><span class="bign"><strong>Applications</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;It can be difficult to keep track of all the application updates to keep your application protected. Many applications will include an agent that keeps track of your software version and then notifies you when a new software version is available. Some agents will download the new software and then prompt for installation. Unfortunately, for the average computer running many applications, this can result in applications requesting to update all the time.</p>
<p class="indent">The solution is to turn off the agents and use a single third-party tool to manage the updates. Third-party solutions can scan the entire server or workstation to identify the software on it. The third-party vendor keeps track of the latest versions of all software and pushes the updates down to the computer through its tool.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Storage Components</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Storage systems are one of the more complex items to update. An update to a storage system, also called storage array firmware or microcode, could impact other items in the data path such as SAN switches or HBAs. Before applying a storage system update, ensure that devices on the data path (everything from the SAN to the initiator) support the upgrade. Devices on the data path often include the switch and HBA versions, but could include other devices as well.</p>
<p class="indent">If all firmware versions for the devices in the data path meet the acceptable level for the storage upgrade, go ahead and install it. However, if a device is not supported at its current firmware level, you will need to upgrade it to a supported level first. Ensure that when you upgrade it, the updated version is supported on the current SAN version.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Clusters</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Updates for cluster nodes can be done typically with no downtime to the end user. This is great for the end user, but the upgrade process is a bit more complicated for IT administrators. You will need to fail over services to free up a node so that it is not actively hosting any of the cluster resources and then update that node. You can then fail back services to that node and fail over the services on another node. Complete this process on all nodes until each node is running the same software versions.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch9lev238">Maintenance Automation</h4>
<p class="noindent">It can be quite a job to maintain a large number of systems, and organizational IT departments are supporting more devices per person than ever before. They accomplish this through automation. Automation uses scripting, scheduled tasks, and automation tools to do the routine tasks so that IT staff can spend more time solving the real problems and proactively looking for ways to make things better and even more efficient.</p>
<p class="indent">PowerShell commands are provided in many examples because these commands can be used with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) CLI or the Microsoft Azure Cloud Shell. Scripts can be combined into tasks using AWS Systems Manager or Microsoft Azure runbooks.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_280" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>This section discusses different activities that can be automated to save time and standardize. They include the following:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Patch management</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Shutdown and restart</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Entering maintenance mode</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Enabling or disabling monitoring checks</p>
<h4 class="h4">Server Upgrades and Patches</h4>
<p class="noindent">Server upgrades and patches provide enhancements to the software running on servers that can either provide fixes for known errors or add functionality. However, deploying them can be time-consuming, if performed manually. Fortunately, there are a variety of tools available to automate the patch management process. These tools identify the installed software version number and then query the vendor&#8217;s patch list to identify which patches need to be installed and in which order. Some tools are specific to a vendor, some are built in, and some are available from third parties. For example, Microsoft has packaged an update system into Microsoft Windows. The user can set their system to download and install updates automatically on a set schedule or as soon as they are released. Other third-party solutions can query the system to identify all applications and then identify the patches available for those systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Patch management systems can be configured to install available updates automatically or to install only approved updates. In approval mode, an administrator reviews updates, potentially applying them to a series of test systems, and if the patches appear stable, the administrator approves the patches for deployment across the enterprise.</p>
<p class="indent">If systems are configured to download patches automatically, those patches might trigger a restart of the system. Ensure that patch installation occurs during a period where the workstation or server can be taken offline.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Restarting</h4>
<p class="noindent">Systems run better when they are restarted regularly. However, regular restarts is not an option for all environments, but for those that can, a scheduled restart can help keep systems fresh and functional. Scheduled restarts are useful in other scenarios such as when you are performing maintenance on a host or some other system that requires many machines to be restarted.</p>
<p class="indentb">Here is a PowerShell command that restarts four computers named computer1, computer2, computer3, and computer4. You can schedule this script to run as a scheduled task from a management machine that has rights on each of the other servers.</p>
<p class="indenttb"><img src="../Images/image01177.jpeg" width="770" height="37" alt="Images"/></p>
<h4 class="h4"><span id="page_281" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Shutting Down</h4>
<p class="noindent">Scheduled shutdown events are useful in maintenance or triage scenarios, such as when you are turning off all nonessential systems to save on resources.</p>
<p class="indentb">Here is a PowerShell command that shuts down four computers named computer1, computer2, computer3, and computer4. You can schedule this script to run as a scheduled task from a management machine that has rights on each of the other servers.</p>
<p class="indenttb"><img src="../Images/image01178.jpeg" width="737" height="38" alt="Images"/></p>
<h4 class="h4">Entering Maintenance Mode</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whenever you do work on a host, it is important to put that host in maintenance mode. In fact, many maintenance tasks cannot be performed unless the host is first in maintenance mode. Some maintenance activities include restarting the host, applying firmware updates, or applying patches to the host.</p>
<p class="indent">Maintenance mode will migrate all the virtual machines to another host in a cluster and prepare the host for maintenance. Exiting maintenance mode will allow for virtual machines to be rebalanced across hosts in the cluster.</p>
<p class="indentb">Many maintenance tasks can be scripted, and the transition to maintenance mode can also be placed in the maintenance script to automate the entire process. The following command can be scripted in to enter into maintenance mode. Here we will assume our username is ESXAdmin and our password is 77}N50&#38;a9fr-Q&#61;i.</p>
<p class="indenttb"><img src="../Images/image01179.jpeg" width="667" height="38" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="indentb">You can then script the transition out of maintenance mode in the script when the maintenance is complete. The following command can be placed at the end of the script to exit maintenance mode (assuming the same username and password):</p>
<p class="indenttb"><img src="../Images/image01180.jpeg" width="667" height="38" alt="Images"/></p>
<h4 class="h4">Enabling or Disabling Monitoring Alerts</h4>
<p class="noindent">It can be very annoying to receive hundreds or thousands of e-mail notifications because someone forgot to disable monitoring alerts when doing a downtime. Everyone who has gone through this knows what this means, because it simply destroys a mailbox. The good news is that if you forget, your coworkers are likely to remind you and not let you forget again.</p>
<p class="indent">Disabling alerts greatly depends on which tool is being used to send out the alerts, but there is usually a master pause function that can be enabled for the downtime. If you have regularly occurring downtimes such as patch downtimes, you can likely script this action.<span id="page_282" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>
<h5 class="h5-gg" id="ch9lev239">CERTIFICATION SUMMARY</h5>
<hr class="hrg"/>
<p class="noindent">Successful delivery of a cloud solution is driven not just by the technical components that make up that solution but by clear policies and standard operating procedures. The successful design, documentation, and methodical implementation and support of those technical resources result in an effective solution that is profitable for the IT provider and valuable to its customers.</p>
<p class="indent">Processes and procedures allow for control of the environment through life cycle metrics, dashboards and reporting, standardization, and planning. These control mechanisms make certain that the environments are designed to meet business requirements and are deployed and supported according to that design.</p>
<p class="indent">IT systems require regular maintenance to keep them free from vulnerabilities and bugs, and to keep up with the latest technologies and processes. Maintenance and development updates can consume a great deal of IT personnel time. Maintenance and development are core to the business. This includes making code updates, documenting those updates in code repositories, ensuring that patches are applied to systems in a timely manner, and automating common maintenance tasks to do more with limited IT resources.</p>
<h5 class="h5-ggg" id="ch9lev240">KEY TERMS</h5>
<p class="noindent">Use the following list to review the key terms discussed in this chapter. The definitions also can be found in the glossary.</p>

Better control of system access results in better security. Uniform logging across systems ensures that organizationally required information is logged and maintained.</p>

Developers can publish code changes to the repository, can synchronize their local copy of the code with the repository, or can revert to previously published versions.</p>

Continuous integration is a method for automating elements of the code process, but there is not an application called a continuous integration application. Workflow automation is useful to take standard processes and have them performed by a machine. Donna could take her existing process and automate it, but that would still result in difficulties managing the code of three developers. Chargebacks are used to bill for usage of IT services and would not help in this situation except to bill for how much programming the developers do.</p>
