<p class="noindent-d"><span class="dropcap">A</span>n organization&#8217;s data must be backed up, and key processes like payroll and billing need to be continually available even if the organization&#8217;s data center is lost due to a disaster. Choosing a disaster recovery method is an important step in a reliable cloud implementation. A cloud computing model can be seen as an alternative to traditional disaster recovery. Cloud computing offers a more rapid recovery time and helps to reduce the costs of a disaster recovery model.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_368" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Protecting organizational data requires different methods depending on the situation. Business continuity (BC) is the set of plans, procedures, and technologies necessary to ensure continued business operations or minimal disruption when incidents, technology failures, or mistakes happen. BC is different from disaster recovery (DR) in that BC is a holistic way of keeping things running, while disaster recovery (DR) addresses major events that have the potential to take down a company if the right controls are not in place. Organizations typically have a disaster recovery plan (DRP) that can be followed for specific major events. Backup and recovery are integral to both BC and DR. These functions are also useful for events that do not strain the business, such as when a user accidentally overwrites a non-urgent file and needs it recovered. Backup and recovery is used for the significant and major events as well as those not impacting business continuity and disaster recovery scenarios.</p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch12lev295">Business Continuity Methods</h3>
<p class="noindent">Business continuity (BC) encompasses the activities that enable an organization to continue functioning, including offering services, delivering products, and conducting other activities deemed integral to running the business, during and following a disruptive incident such as data corruption, employee mistakes, a malware breach, a malicious insider attack, a system hack, or a major component failure.</p>
<p class="indent">Business continuity is also concerned with recovering data or systems if and when they are harmed.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev296">Business Continuity Plan</h4>
<p class="noindent">An organization makes its guidelines known through a business continuity plan (BCP), and it enacts its guidelines through business continuity management (BCM). BCM is the process the organization goes through to create procedures to deal with threats to data integrity, data exfiltration, data confidentiality, data availability, employee safety, asset integrity, brand image, and customer relationships. The process defines the threats to those organizational resources and outlines the safeguards and practices designed to protect them from harm.</p>
<p class="indent">BCM is concerned with protecting organizational resources from harm and relies on contingency and resiliency.<span id="page_369" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev297">Contingency</h4>
<p class="noindent">A major portion of the BCP is concerned with contingency. Contingency planning involves establishing alternate practices, sites, and resources that can be used in an emergency or to establish high availability (discussed later in this section).</p>
<p class="indent">In the contingency section of the BCP, the organization establishes a generalized capability and readiness to cope effectively with potential disasters. Contingency preparations constitute a last-resort response if resilience and recovery arrangements should prove inadequate in practice. Still, if the BCP is to be complete, it must have documented, planned for, and mapped-out contingencies.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Alternatives</h4>
<p class="noindent">In the contingency component of the BCP, the organization establishes a generalized capability and readiness to cope effectively with whatever incidents compromise business operations, including those that were not, and perhaps could not have been, foreseen.</p>
<p class="indent">Alternative preparations constitute a last-resort response if resilience and recovery arrangements should prove inadequate in practice. Still, if a BCP is to be complete, it must have documented, planned for, and mapped out how it will handle alternatives when primary resources are unavailable.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Alternate Sites</h4>
<p class="noindent">Alternate sites are an essential part of business continuity. For example, hot and warm sites require replication to keep data consistent. Hot sites would require continuous replication, while a warm site would require scheduled replication at certain points throughout the day, week, or month.</p>
<p class="indent">Using a remote site helps provide a more advanced business continuity solution since the entire site is protected in case of a disaster. Multisite configurations rely on a backup site where a company can quickly relocate its computer equipment if a disaster occurs at its primary location and data center. The backup site needs to be either another location that the company owns and has available to implement additional equipment or a space that it rents from another provider for an annual or monthly fee.</p>
<p class="indent">There are three types of backup sites an organization can use: a cold site, a hot site, and a warm site. The difference between each site is determined by the administrative effort to implement and maintain them and the costs involved with each type.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>Cold Site</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Of the three backup site options, the least expensive is the cold site. A cold site does not include any backup copies of data from the organization&#8217;s original data center. When an organization implements a cold site, it does not have readily available hardware at the site; it has only the physical space and network connectivity for recovery operations, and is responsible for providing the hardware. Because there is no hardware at the backup site, the cost for a cold site is lower; however, not having readily available hardware at the <span id="page_370" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>cold site is also one of its downfalls. Since there is no hardware set up and ready to use at the backup site, it takes the organization longer to get up and operating after a disaster, which could end up costing it more than the extra expense of a warm or hot site, depending on the type of organization.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>Hot Site</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;A hot site, on the other hand, is a duplicate of the original site of the organization and has readily available hardware and a near-complete backup of the organization&#8217;s data. A hot site can have real-time synchronization between the original site and the backup site and can be used to mirror the original data center completely. If the original site is impacted by a disaster, the hot site is available for the organization to quickly relocate to, with minimal impact on the normal operations of the organization. This is the most expensive type of backup site and is popular with organizations that need this level of disaster recovery, including financial institutions and e-commerce providers.</p>

<div class="side1">
<p class="indent"><strong>A hot site is the most expensive multisite configuration but provides the quickest recovery time in the event of a disaster.</strong></p>
</div>
<hr class="hr-si1" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bign"><strong>Warm Site</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;A warm site is somewhere on the continuum between a cold site and a hot site. It has readily available hardware but on a much smaller scale than the original site or a hot site. Warm sites will also have backups at the location, but they may not be complete backups, or they might be a few days old.</p>
<p class="indent">Determining an acceptable RTO for an organization helps a cloud administrator choose between the three types of backup sites. A hot site might have an RTO of a few hours, whereas a cold site might have an RTO of a day or more. It is important that the organization and the cloud administrator completely understand the RTO of an application or service and the cost required to operate at that RTO. A hot site provides faster recovery time but also has a much higher cost than a warm site. While a cold site is the least expensive to set up, it also takes the longest to implement in the event of a disaster. Understanding the benefits and costs of each of the three types of backup sites will help an organization determine which backup type best fits its needs and which backup strategy it should implement.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Site Mirroring</h4>
<p class="noindent">A mirror site is either a hosted website or set of files that is an exact copy of the original site and resides on one or more separate computers from the original. This mirror copy ensures that the website or files are accessible from multiple locations to increase availability and reduce network traffic on the original site. It is updated on a regular basis to reflect any changes in content from the original site.</p>
<p class="indent">A set of distributed mirrored servers can be set up to reflect geographic discrepancies, making it faster to download from various places throughout the world in what is known as a content delivery network (CDN). For example, a site that is heavily used in the United States <span id="page_371" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>might have multiple mirror sites throughout the country, or even a mirror site in Germany, so that end users who are trying to download the files can access a site that is in closer proximity to their location.</p>
<p class="indent">Sites that offer a large array of software downloads and have a large amount of network traffic can use mirror sites to meet the demand for the downloads and improve response time for the end user. For example, Microsoft often has multiple mirror sites available for users to download its software, and <a href="http://Download.com">Download.com</a> (<a href="http://download.cnet.com">http://download.cnet.com</a>) often has mirror sites so that end users can retrieve files from a location that is closer to them.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev298">Resiliency</h4>
<p class="noindent">The BCP should define how the organization will implement resiliency. Resiliency requires designing systems that can still service the company when problems arise. It accomplishes this primarily through redundancy. Cloud service providers achieve resiliency by architecting cloud and information systems that can withstand assault or faults. Security controls protect against assault (see <a href="part0024.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>) and redundancy protects against component failure or failure of integrated or dependent third-party systems such as the power grid, hosting provider, or key toolset.</p>
<p class="indent">Redundant components protect the system from a failure and can include power supplies, switches, network interface cards, and hard disks. An example of a redundant system is RAID, which employs methods to guard against the failure of one or more drives depending on the RAID level. Review <a href="part0016.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2</a> if this seems unfamiliar. Another example is NIC teaming, where two or more NICs are combined into one logical NIC. If the cable, NIC, or switch link for one fails, the others will still remain to service the server.</p>
<p class="indent">A redundant component means you have more of that component than you need. For example, a virtualization host computer might have two power supplies to make it redundant, but it can function with a single power supply. A data center may have four connections to four different ISPs, but it can function with any one of them, except that it would incur bursting charges for additional bandwidth used.</p>
<p class="indent">Redundant does not mean that there is not an impact to performance or a cost if a component fails; it means that service can be restored to working condition (although the condition may be in a degraded state), without the need for external components. Redundancy differs from fault tolerance in that fault tolerance allows the system to tolerate a fault and continue running in spite of it. Fault tolerance is discussed in more detail later in the chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Once an organization has established the BCP and created redundant systems, it can implement failover. Failover uses a constant communication mechanism between two systems called a heartbeat. As long as this heartbeat continues uninterrupted, failover to the redundant system will not initiate. If the heartbeat between the systems fails, the redundant system will take over processing for the primary system. If the primary system becomes operational again, the organization can initiate a failback. Failback is the process of restoring the processing back to the original state before the failure of the primary system.<span id="page_372" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev299">High Availability</h4>
<p class="noindent">High availability (HA) is a system design approach that ensures a system or component is continuously available for a predefined length of time. Organizations need to have their applications and services available to end users at all times. If end users cannot access a service or application, it is considered to be unavailable, and the period during which it is unavailable is commonly referred to as downtime.</p>
<p class="indent">Downtime comes in two different forms: scheduled downtime and unscheduled downtime. Scheduled downtime is downtime that has been predefined in a service contract that allows an administrator to perform routine maintenance on a system, like installing critical updates, firmware, or service packs.</p>
<p class="indent">Unscheduled downtime usually involves an interruption to a service or application due to a physical event, such as a power outage, hardware failure, or security breach. Most organizations exclude scheduled downtime from their availability calculation for an application or service as long as the scheduled maintenance does not impact the end users.</p>
<p class="indent">Having an infrastructure that is redundant and highly available helps an organization provide a consistent environment and a more productive workforce. Determining which systems require the investment to be highly available is up to each organization. There will be some systems or applications that do not need to be highly available and do not warrant the cost involved to make them so.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the benefits of a public cloud model is that the cost of making the systems highly available falls on the cloud provider and allows the cloud consumer to take advantage of that highly available system.</p>
<p class="indent">If a system is not highly available, it means that the system will fail if a single component fails. For example, if a system that is not highly available has a single power supply and that power supply fails, the entire system will be unavailable until the power supply can be replaced.</p>
<p class="indent">Determining which systems and which applications require redundancy can help reduce costs and administrative overhead. A policy should be created to determine the expected availability for each application. This will govern whether HA features are required on the systems housing the application.</p>
<p class="indent">An organization might use a scale of 0 to 4 to rate the availability requirements of an application. In that scenario, an application that has a rating of 0 would need to be available 99.99 percent of the time, whereas an application with a rating of 4 might only have to be available 98 percent of the time. Creating a scale allows an organization to prioritize its applications and appropriately distribute costs so that it can maximize its compute resources.</p>
<p class="text-icon"><img src="../Images/image01119.jpeg" width="58" height="40" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="text-icon1"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Recently we worked with an organization to help define its business continuity plan (BCP). The organization had never done a BCP and had not envisioned how to start creating a highly available environment. To get the organization&#8217;s team started, we had them define the importance of all the applications they were currently using. After putting a priority on each of the applications, the organization was able to clearly identify the level of redundancy and availability required for each system to function efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span id="page_373" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Fault Tolerance</h4>
<p class="noindent">Fault tolerance allows a computer system to function as normal in the event of a failure in one or more of the system&#8217;s components. Fault-tolerant systems are designed for high availability and reliability by installing redundant hardware components. For example, a virtualization host computer would have multiple CPUs, power supplies, and hard disks in the same physical computer. If one of the components were to fail, the spare component would take over without bringing the system down. However, having a system that is truly fault-tolerant does result in greater expense because the system requires additional components to achieve fault-tolerant status.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>Fault tolerance allows the system to tolerate a fault and to continue to run in spite of it.</strong></p>

<hr class="hr-si1" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>Clustering</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Connecting multiple computers to provide parallel processing and redundancy is known as clustering. Clustering allows for two or more computers to be connected to act as a single computer. The computers are connected over a fast local area network (LAN), and each node (i.e., each computer used as a server) constituting the cluster runs its own operating system. Clusters can thereby improve performance and availability as compared to using a single computer, and clusters are used often in the cloud for Big Data analysis.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>Geo-clustering</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Geo-clustering allows for the connection of multiple redundant computers while those computers are located in different geographical locations. So instead of having the nodes connected over a LAN, the nodes are connected over a wide area network (WAN) but still appear as a single highly available system. Geo-clustering allows an organization to support enterprise-level continuity by providing a system that is location independent.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Multipathing</h4>
<p class="noindent">Having a fault-tolerant system is a great start to achieving high availability, but it is not the only requirement. When planning for high availability, all aspects of the network must be considered. If the connection between the fault-tolerant systems is a single point of failure, then it is limiting the high availability of the system. Implementing multipathing allows for the configuration of multiple paths for connectivity to a storage device, providing redundancy for the system to connect to the storage device.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Load Balancing</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another component of high availability is load balancing. Load balancing allows you to distribute a workload across multiple computers, networks, and disk drives. Load balancing helps to optimize workloads and resources, allowing for maximum throughput and helps <span id="page_374" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>minimize response times for the end user. Load balancing can also help to create reliability with the use of multiple computers instead of a single computer and is delivered either with dedicated software or hardware.</p>
<p class="indent">Load balancing uses the resources of multiple systems to provide a single, specific Internet service. It can be used with a website or a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site to distribute the load of web or file requests between two or more servers. Load balancing can distribute incoming HTTP requests across multiple web servers in a server farm, which can help distribute the load across multiple servers to prevent overloading any single server. If one of the servers in the server farm starts to become overwhelmed, load balancing begins to distribute HTTP requests to another node in the server farm so that no one node becomes overloaded.</p>
<p class="indent">Load balancers are supplied with an IP address and fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that is typically mapped through NAT and a firewall to an external DNS name for cloud resources. This IP address and FQDN represent the load balancer, but client connections are handled by one of the members of the load-balanced system. Internally the load balancer tracks the individual IP addresses of its members.</p>
<p class="text-icon"><img src="../Images/image01119.jpeg" width="58" height="40" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="text-icon1"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Recently we were tasked with creating a solution for a website that was being overwhelmed with incoming requests. The solution was to deploy a hardware load balancer and to add two additional web servers to a server farm. By adding load balancing, we were able to distribute the incoming requests across three servers, thus improving performance and reliability for the organization and the website.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev300">Service Level Agreements for BCP and HA</h4>
<p class="noindent">A service level agreement (SLA) is a contract that specifies the level of uptime that will be supported by the service provider. SLAs are used with Internet service providers, cloud solutions, and a variety of other technology solutions.</p>
<p class="indent">Review the SLA damage clauses when purchasing a complete HA solution. SLAs include provisions for how the service provider will compensate customers if SLAs are not met. At a minimum, these include some monetary compensation for the time the system was down that may be credited toward future invoices. Sometimes the provider must pay fines or damages for lost revenue or lost customer satisfaction. Ensure that the SLA specifies the expected amount of uptime and that damages for SLA violations are sufficient to cover losses due to unexpected downtime.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, when providing a solution to customers, ensure that you construct SLAs that are consistent with the HA capabilities of your systems. For example, you would not want to create an SLA that states five nines of availability if the underlying systems are only able to provide four nines.<span id="page_375" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch12lev301">Disaster Recovery Methods</h3>
<p class="noindent">When an organization is choosing a disaster recovery method, it has to measure the level of service required. This means understanding how critical the application or server is and then determining the proper disaster recovery method for it. When implementing disaster recovery, it is important to form disaster recovery plans (DRPs) that will describe how the organization is going to deal with potential disasters such as fires, floods, earthquakes, entire site failure, or blackouts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is first necessary to focus on those applications or servers that are mission critical in the DRP. A mission-critical system is any system whose failure would result in the failure of business operations. These systems need to be identified and backed by a proper disaster recovery method to ensure there is no lost revenue for the organization.</p>
<p class="indent">Location is also important. The company will need to determine where to place the disaster recovery center. Geographic diversity should be taken into account when planning for a disaster that may impact a particular geographic region. Disasters come in many forms, including natural disasters, so placing the disaster recovery center in a location that is 1000 miles away might prevent the same natural disaster from destroying both the primary data center and the disaster recovery center.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev302">Corporate Guidelines</h4>
<p class="noindent">Corporate guidelines should be established so that employees understand the company&#8217;s expectations for how a disaster will be handled and their own responsibilities if a disaster were to occur. Corporate guidelines are expressed through a set of plans and policies that have been approved by company leadership such as a CEO, CSO, or an executive group such as an information security steering committee. The first of these documents is the disaster recovery plan (DRP). An organization makes its DR guidelines known through the DRP and it is likely the most comprehensive DR document. Other documents are usually created by departments in support of DR initiatives, such as employee rosters, emergency checklists, emergency contact numbers, system documentation, system dependency sheets, triage lists, and so forth. This section will focus mainly on the DRP, but it is good to be aware of some of the documents just mentioned.</p>
<p class="indent">After a discussion on the DRP, this section introduces metrics that the organization can use to determine when components might fail or cause problems. These metrics are good to know because they will likely appear in some of the documents mentioned previously. Lastly, DR defines parameters for what losses are acceptable during recovery in terms of how much data can be lost and how much time can be spent recovering. These are defined as the recovery time objective (RTO) and the recovery point objective (RPO). Both concepts are explained in their own subsection at the end of this section.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span id="page_376" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Disaster Recovery Plan</h4>
<p class="noindent">An organization makes its guidelines for how a disaster will be handled in a disaster recovery plan (DRP). The DRP outlines the procedures to deal with threats to data, systems, and employees, such as fires, floods, hurricanes, tornados, critical infrastructure failure, pandemics, or active shooter situations. The DRP defines the threats to those organizational resources and outlines the safeguards and practices designed to allow the company to operate in a different location, using different resources while primary resources are being restored.</p>
<p class="indent">The DRP establishes a generalized capability and readiness to cope effectively with potential disasters. Disaster preparations constitute a last-resort response if resilience and recovery (elements of the BCP) should prove inadequate in practice. Still, if the DRP is to be complete, it must have documented, planned for, and mapped-out contingencies.</p>
<h4 class="h4">DR Metrics</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another factor to consider when planning for DR is hardware health metrics. Some important hardware health metrics include</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Mean time between failures (MTBF)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Mean time to repair (MTTR)</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Self-monitoring, analysis, and reporting technology (SMART)</p>
<p class="indent">MTBF is the average length of time a device will function before it fails. MTBF can be used to determine approximately how long a hard drive will last in a server. It can also be used to plan how long it might take for a particular hardware component to fail, and thereby help with the creation of a DRP.</p>
<p class="indent">MTTR, on the other hand, is the average length of time that it takes to repair a failed hardware component. MTTR needs to be a factor in the DRP, as it is often part of the maintenance contract for the virtualization host computers. An MTTR of 24 hours or less would be appropriate for a higher-priority server, whereas a lower-priority server might have an MTTR of seven days.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, SMART is a set of hard disk metrics that are used to predict failures by monitoring over 100 metrics such as read error rate, spin-up time, start and stop count, reallocated sectors count, and seek error rate. SMART has predefined thresholds for each metric, and those thresholds are used to determine if a drive is in an OK, warning, or error status. All of these factors need to be considered in the DRP for the organization to have a successful disaster recovery environment.</p>
<h4 class="h4">RTO</h4>
<p class="noindentb">The recovery time objective (RTO) is the maximum tolerable amount of time between an outage and the restoration of the service before an organization suffers unacceptable losses. <span id="page_377" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>RTO will involve many tasks. The following is the general sequence of tasks that must be performed:</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Notify IT or cloud backup operations of the need for a restore.</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Locate restoration archive or media that contains the required data, such as cloud storage, local storage, a remote data center, or tape. If tape, identify if the tape is on-site or off-site. If the tape is off-site, pick it up and bring it to the location where the restore will take place.</p>

<h4 class="h4"><span id="page_378" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>RPO</h4>
<p class="noindent">The recovery point objective (RPO) is the maximum amount of time in which data can be lost for a service due to a major incident. The RPO determines how often backups should take place. For example, if the RPO is 24 hours, then backups would occur daily.</p>
<p class="indent">The organization should not treat all data the same. Some data might need to have a different RPO because it has different availability needs. For example, a database of customer orders might have a RPO of 1 minute, whereas web file RPO might be 24 hours because updates are made no more than once per day, and web files are also located in web developer repositories.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the things that should be considered and that can help meet expected RTO and RPO is redundancy. A redundant system can be used to provide a backup to a primary system in the case of failure.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev303">Replication</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replication transfers data between two or more systems so that any changes to the data are made on each node in the replica set. A replica set consists of the systems that will all retain the same data. Replication can occur between systems at the same site, termed intrasite replication, or between systems at different sites, termed intersite replication. Multiple sites are used to protect data when a single site is unavailable and also to ensure low-latency availability by serving data from sources that are close to the end user or application.</p>
<p class="indent">As discussed in <a href="part0017.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3</a>, two forms of replication can be used to keep replica sets consistent. Synchronous replication writes data to the local store and then immediately replicates it to the replica set or sets. The application is not informed that the data has been written until all replica sets have acknowledged receipt and storage of the data. Asynchronous replication stores the data locally and then reports back to the application that the data has been stored. It then sends the data to replication partners at its next opportunity.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev304">File Transfer</h4>
<p class="noindent">In lieu of some backups, an organization may choose to perform a file transfer or a scheduled synchronization of files instead. This is quite common in replication scenarios. It is important when synchronizing files for the intent of archiving that you configure them to not synchronize deletes. Additionally, changes on one side are going to be reflected on the other side, so synchronizations are not useful in preserving those changes.</p>
<p class="indent">A one-time file transfer is a great way to get a point-in-time copy for data that does not change so that you do not need to keep backing it up with every full backup that occurs. A one-time backup can be performed and then stored away for whenever it is needed. If data has remained unchanged since the one-time backup, the backup will still be consistent even though it has not been updated.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_379" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>One-time backups can reduce space on backup drives and reduce the length of time required to perform backups. Ensure that if you do a one-time file transfer that you lock the files so that they cannot be changed in production. Otherwise, you might find at some later date that people have been changing the files but there is no active backup for the data.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev305">Service Level Agreements for DR</h4>
<p class="noindent">As mentioned earlier in this chapter, a service level agreement (SLA) is a contract that specifies the level of uptime that will be supported by the service provider. SLAs should be obtained for each of the systems that will be relied upon for the DR solution. It would be a shame to failover to a DR site, only to find that the site did not meet availability expectations. Customers who have recently suffered a downtime do not want to experience other downtimes shortly thereafter so you want to ensure that your DR site will provide the required service level.</p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch12lev306">Backup and Recovery</h3>
<p class="noindent">A backup set is a secondary copy of the organization&#8217;s data and is used to replace the original data in the event of a loss. The backup process needs to be monitored just like any other process that is running in the environment. Proper monitoring of the backup system helps to ensure that the data is available if there is a disaster.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, a backup is only as good as the restore strategy that is in place. Testing the restoration process of all the backups in an organization should be done on a scheduled and routine basis. Backups can be fully automated and scheduled so that they can run without interaction from an administrator.</p>
<p class="indent">A proper disaster recovery and data retention plan should be established to ensure that data loss is consistent with the RPO if a disaster occurs. The backup plan should include how the data is to be stored and, if the data is going to be stored off-site, how long it is kept off-site and how many copies are kept at the off-site facility. The backup plan should also specify how the data will be recovered.</p>
<p class="indent">Selecting the appropriate backup solution is a critical piece of a properly configured disaster recovery implementation. Creating a backup is simply the process of copying and archiving data so that the data is available to be restored to either the original location or an alternate location should the original data be lost, modified, or corrupted.</p>
<p class="indent">Creating backups of data serves two primary purposes. The first purpose of a backup is to restore data that is lost because either it was deleted or it became corrupt. The second purpose of a backup is to enable recovery of data from an earlier time frame.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_380" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>An organization should have a data retention policy that specifies how long data needs to be kept. For example, if an organization has a data retention policy that specifies all data must be kept for two weeks, an end user who needs to have a document restored from ten days ago could do so.</p>
<p class="indent">When selecting a backup policy, several things need to be taken into consideration. First, the organization must determine how the backups will be stored, whether on tape, optical media, NAS, external disk, or a cloud-based storage system. Cloud storage can emulate a virtual tape library (VTL) so that existing on-premises backup solutions can see it.</p>
<p class="indent">If data is stored on removable media such as tapes, optical media, or external disks, first determine if the backups should be stored at an off-site location. Storing backups at an off-site location allows for recovery of the data in the event of a site disaster. After choosing a media type, the next step is to choose the style of backup.</p>
<p class="indent">Cloud backups exist in the cloud provider&#8217;s data center so they are already outside of the organization and, thus &#8220;off-site.&#8221; Cloud backups are an effective way to perform off-site backups without a large infrastructure. Files from cloud backups are easier to manage and often faster to retrieve than off-site tapes or removable media.</p>
<p class="indent">The available backup types are discussed next. Each backup type has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev307">Backup Types</h4>
<p class="noindent">An organization can structure backups in multiple ways to strike a balance between the length of time it takes to conduct a backup and the length of time it takes to perform a restore operation. Backup types also offer different levels of recoverability, some requiring the presence of another backup to be functional. The available backup types include the following:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Full backup</p>

<p class="bullb"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Imaging</p>
<p class="noindent">Backups utilize features such as change or delta tracking and can be stored online or offline. We will discuss those topics before covering the various backup types.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Change/Delta Tracking</h4>
<p class="noindent">Some backup types archive information depending on whether it has been backed up recently or if it has changed since the last backup. File change status is tracked using a flag on files called the archive bit. When a full backup is performed, the archive bit is set to 0. If that file changes, the archive bit is set to 1.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span id="page_381" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Online and Offline Backups</h4>
<p class="noindent">Online backups are those that are available to restore immediately, while offline backups must be brought online before they are available to restore. Some offline backups include tape backups and removable hard drives. A backup tape is offline because it must be retrieved and inserted into a tape drive before it is available to restore. Similarly, a backup hard drive stored in a safe deposit box is offline.</p>
<p class="indent">Online backups include nearline and cloud backups. Nearline backups are written to media that is on the network such as a NAS, a local backup server, or shared storage on a server. These backups are online because they can be retrieved without having to insert media. Cloud backups are also online backups because they are always available. Both of these online options can be restored at any time.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Full Backup</h4>
<p class="noindent">A full system backup backs up the entire system, including everything on the hard drive. It makes a copy of all the data and files on the drive in a single process. A full backup takes up the most space on storage media because it does a full drive copy every time the backup is executed. Performing a full backup every day requires the same amount of space on the backup media as the drive being backed up.</p>
<p class="indent">The benefit to a full backup is that an organization can take any of the backups from any day they were executed and restore data from a single backup media. The full backup resets the archive bit on all files on the computer to 0. <a href="part0026.xhtml#ch12fig2">Figure 12-2</a> shows an example of how a full system backup would look after four backups.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch12fig2"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 12-2</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Illustration of a full system backup</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01204.jpeg" width="748" height="293" alt="Images"/></p>
<h4 class="h4">Differential Backup</h4>
<p class="noindent">The differential backup backs up only those changes that were made since the last full backup was executed. To perform a differential backup, a full backup must have been performed on the dataset previously.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_382" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>After the full backup is executed, every differential backup executed thereafter will contain only the changes made since the last full backup. The differential backup knows which data has been changed because of the archive bit. Each changed file results in a file with an archive bit set to 1. The differential backup does not change the archive bit when it backs up the files, so each successive differential backup includes the files that changed since the last full backup because full backups do reset the archive bit.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the disadvantages to differential backups is that the time it takes to complete the backup will increase as files change between the last full backup. Another disadvantage is that if the organization wants to restore an entire system to a particular point in time, it must first locate the last full backup taken prior to the point of failure and the last differential backup since the last full backup.</p>

<hr class="hr-si1" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/>
<p class="indent">For example, if full backups are taken every Friday night and differentials are taken each night in between, to restore a system on Wednesday to the Tuesday backup would require the full backup and the Tuesday differential. <a href="part0026.xhtml#ch12fig3">Figure 12-3</a> shows an example of how a differential backup looks after three days.</p>

<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01205.jpeg" width="748" height="295" alt="Images"/></p>
<h4 class="h4">Incremental Backup</h4>
<p class="noindent">An incremental backup also backs up only those files that have changed since the last backup was executed, but the last backup can be either a full backup or an incremental backup. Incremental backups do reset the archive bit to 0 when they back up files, so the next incremental backup does not back up that file again unless it has changed again. To perform an incremental backup, a full backup must have been carried out on the dataset previously.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_383" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Backing up only files that have changed since the last backup makes incremental backups faster and requires less space. However, the time it takes to perform a restoration is longer because many backup files could need to be processed. Restores require the last full backup and all the incremental backups since the last full.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>Incremental backups require less space to store the backup and complete much more quickly but require more time to perform a restoration.</strong></p>

<p class="indent">For example, if full backups are taken every Friday night and incrementals are taken each night in between, to restore a system on Wednesday to the Tuesday backup would require the full backup, the Saturday incremental, Sunday incremental, Monday incremental, and Tuesday incremental. <a href="part0026.xhtml#ch12fig4">Figure 12-4</a> shows an example of how an incremental backup would look after three backups.</p>

<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01206.jpeg" width="748" height="293" alt="Images"/></p>
<h4 class="h4">Snapshot</h4>
<p class="noindent">A snapshot captures the state of a virtual machine or volume at the specific time when the snapshot was taken. While similar to a backup, a snapshot should not be considered a replacement for traditional backups. A virtual machine snapshot can be used to preserve the state and data of a virtual machine at a specific point in time. A snapshot can be taken before a major software installation, and if the installation fails or causes issues, the virtual machine can be restored to the state it was in when the snapshot was taken.</p>
<p class="indent">Other cloud data such as websites hosted in the cloud or cloud data stores perform storage snapshots that operate similarly to a virtual machine snapshot except that they are only concerned with the data stored in the snapped location.</p>
<p class="indent">Multiple snapshots can be taken. A series of snapshots is organized into a snapshot chain. A snapshot keeps a delta file of all the changes after the snapshot was taken. The delta file records the differences between the current state of the disk and the state the disk was in <span id="page_384" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>when the snapshot was taken. A marker in the chain allows the cloud provider to know which points represent snapshots.</p>
<p class="indent">Snapshots and snapshot chains can be created and managed in a variety of different ways. It is possible to create snapshots, revert to any snapshot in the chain, mount snapshots as data stores to view individual files, or even delete snapshots.</p>
<p class="indent">Since snapshots are not a replacement for regular backups, they should only be kept for a short period, preferably a few days. A snapshot continues to record from its point of origin, so if the snapshot is kept for long periods of time, the file will continue to grow larger and might eventually become too large to remove or cause disk storage constraints. This can cause performance issues for the cloud resource. If there is a need to keep a snapshot longer than a few days, it is recommended to create a full system backup.</p>

<p class="text-icon1"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>We were asked to deploy a new application to a development server. The new application was being deployed to the development environment because it had never been tested. Instead of taking a backup of the development server before installing the application, we simply created a snapshot of the virtual machine before the install in case the new application caused a failure of the server.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Bit-for-Bit Backups</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another type of backup is the bit-for-bit backup, which captures the entire hard drive bit by bit. Because the whole hard drive was captured, the image can be used to restore an entire server in the event of a disaster, allowing the image to be restored on new hardware.</p>
<p class="indent">Creating an image of a server differs from the file-based backups discussed earlier in that the file-based backups only allow you to restore what was configured to be backed up, whereas an image allows for the entire restoration of the server, including files, folders, and operating system. Even if a file backup contains all the data on a drive, it cannot restore partition tables and data to the exact places and states they were in when the backup was taken, and this can cause problems if you try to do a file-level restore on a server&#8217;s operating system drive or on transactional data such as data in Microsoft Exchange, IBM Notes and Domino, or an Oracle database.</p>
<p class="indent">Bit-for-bit backups can be scheduled much like other backup jobs and can be an excellent method for returning a system to a previous state. Bit-for-bit backups are typically used for physical machines in much the same way as a snapshot is used for virtual machines.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Imaging</h4>
<p class="noindent">Images are like bit-for-bit backups in that they are a bit-for-bit copy of the hard drive. However, images are usually taken as a one-time operation rather than a normal scheduled task. Images are taken of machines prior to deploying them to end users. Administrators may restore from the image if the user has issues with the machine at a later date. <span id="page_385" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Some administrators may choose to restore rather than troubleshoot an issue if the issue appears complex. Applying an image can quickly and easily bring a system back to the organizationally approved operating system build and set of software. Images can also be used for bringing systems back to a standard approved state.</p>
<p class="indent">Images can also be taken of machines that are prepped for deployments. Suppose the IT department receives 900 workstations that are all the same. They would configure the first one with all the software, configure it for use, update the system with the latest patches, and then harden the system. They would then image system and deploy the image to the other 899 machines.</p>
<p class="indent">Images can also be used for remote deployments. Similar to the situation described, the IT department would configure the first machine with the software, configuration, and updates and then create an image. That image would be deployed to the network, and computers could PXE boot to the image repository and the image would be deployed to them.</p>
<p class="text-icon"><img src="../Images/image01119.jpeg" width="58" height="40" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="text-icon1"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>One of this book&#8217;s authors used to manage student computer labs for a university. Each lab had identical machines in it. A single image was hosted on a server for each of the labs. Some labs had custom software for certain disciplines, so they were configured with a different image. At startup, each computer would compare the blocks on their machine with the blocks on the image and replace any different ones on the local machine with the ones from the image. If a student had trouble with a machine, they would move to another and let IT know. IT would restart the machine and it would replace changed blocks with the standard ones from the image. In a few minutes, the machine would be back to its normal functional state. The only thing that would require taking the device out of service was actual failed hardware, and the university had a room full of spares. Furthermore, when patches needed to be deployed to the machines, IT would deploy to one machine and then take an image of the machine and place it on the server for deployment. They then ran a script to restart all the machines in the lab to receive the changed blocks from the image.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev308">Backup Target</h4>
<p class="noindent">A backup target is a destination for a backup job. A backup target could be a local folder on another drive, a folder on the network, a cloud drive, a remote site, or a tape, for example. Choose a target that will offer low enough latency to be able to complete backup jobs in the required amount of time and fast enough to meet the RTO.</p>
<p class="indent">Backup targets are sometimes confused with replicas. The two differ in that backup targets are the destination for a backup, whereas replicas are used to create a mirrored copy of the data between the initial target and a replica target.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span id="page_386" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Local</h4>
<p class="noindent">Local targets are those that are on the same network as the source data. These are also called nearline backups. Local targets include backups to another drive on the same machine, backups to a NAS on the local network, or backups to a file server on the local network. This could also include a local cloud appliance that has local storage which is then replicated to the cloud.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Remote</h4>
<p class="noindent">To help reduce downtime in case of a disaster, an organization can set up and configure backups or replication to another site or a cloud service that is off premises. It is less likely that an event affecting the source data will also impact a remote target. For example, a forklift that knocks over a server rack in the data center would not impact the cloud backup. Remote targets include cloud backups, remote data centers, and tapes that are taken off-site.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Replicas</h4>
<p class="noindent">The closer the target is to the source, the faster the backup will run. It will also be faster to restore the data when the target is closer to the source. However, closer targets are riskier because an event that could disrupt services or corrupt the source data might also do the same to the local backup. You do not want to be in a situation where both production systems and backups are unavailable.</p>
<p class="indent">Typically, companies will perform a backup to a local data store in the same data center so that the backup job completes quickly and so the data is available close to the source if necessary. However, this data will then be replicated to a replica such as a cloud service, remote site, or tape.</p>
<p class="indent">Replicas help to improve reliability and fault tolerance. When replicating data, the data is stored on multiple storage devices at different locations so that if one location suffers a disaster, the other location is available with the exact same data. Remote sites are costly to own and operate, so cloud backups have become very popular as a replica.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev309">Other Backup Considerations</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you understand the types of backups and where backups are stored, the next steps are to choose the right backup type for your organization and its RTO, configure the backups to store the right objects, and schedule backups to run at ideal times. Be aware that restoring data may require some dependencies such as backup software, catalogs, decryption keys, and licensing.</p>
<p class="indent">It is also important to ensure that connectivity from source to target is sufficient to back up the data in the required time frame and with minimal impact on other services that may be operating concurrently. Some companies may find that latency is preventing them from meeting backup windows, in which case they can employ edge sites to reduce the latency.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_387" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Next, procure the necessary equipment to conduct backups and restores. If you find that the cost of the equipment is prohibitive for your organization, look to contract with a third party or cloud provider to conduct backups. You will also want to be aware of the availability cost of performing backups or restores and make others aware of activities that could cause performance degradation. The availability cost is the performance impact incurred when backup or restore operations produce contention for available resources. Backup and restore operations could potentially prevent users from performing tasks or they could make systems less desirable to use.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Backup Schedules</h4>
<p class="noindent">Backup jobs must run on a schedule to be effective. A one-time backup can be useful, but it does little to protect company information that changes rapidly. Scheduled jobs allow for backups to operate at regular intervals to back up the files that have changed since the last backup or to back up all files. The determination as to what is backed up in the job is based on the backup type, discussed earlier, such as a full backup, incremental backup, differential backup, snapshot, or bit-for-bit backup.</p>
<p class="indent">Backup schedules should be structured such that they do not impact production activities. Backups can consume a lot of disk and network I/O. Compressed and encrypted backups consume CPU as well. Compression and decompression can place a heavy burden on the server and cause disruptions or poor performance for users if backups run during peak times.</p>
<p class="indent">Most backups will not require downtime, but they could still impact the performance of the virtual machine and the applications that run on top of it. For this reason, it is best to plan backups for times when the load on the system is minimal.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, it would be a bad idea to back up a domain controller at the beginning of the day when users are logging into systems, because that is when the domain controller must authenticate each request. Users would likely see service interruptions if a backup were to take place during such a peak time.</p>
<p class="indent">Virtualized and cloud systems may have users spread across the globe. Additionally, it may be necessary to coordinate resources with cloud vendors or with support personnel in different global regions. In such cases, time zones can be a large constraint for performing backups. It can be difficult to coordinate a time that works for distributed user bases and maintenance teams. In those cases, you might need to provision enough resources on machines so that backups can run concurrently with a full traffic load.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Configurations</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you choose a schedule for the backup jobs, you will also need to configure the appropriate backup type to minimize the impact on production systems and applications, yet meet backup frequency requirements, RTO, and RPO.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_388" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Some common scenarios include performing a full backup weekly and incrementals or differentials daily. Others might choose to do a full backup nightly with hourly incrementals or differentials. Bandwidth and system resources may determine which options are available to you. Of course, if company policy specifies a specific configuration, you may need to upgrade equipment to meet the requirements.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Objects</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the most important decisions when designing backups is determining what to back up. Each item selected for backup is an object. Should you back up the company intranet? What about local machines if the policy states that data should only be stored on the network? The selection of backup objects is one that should be approved by data and application owners. Ensure that senior management sees the list as well to ensure that all data and application owners are represented. You may receive sign-off from the intranet application owner and the end-user support manager to back up local machines and the intranet, but if you forgot to include the e-mail application owner, you might be in trouble when the e-mail server goes down. We cannot stress how important it is to choose the right backup objects.</p>

<p class="text-icon1"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>We were called in to help a company see if they could restore data from a failed RAID array. The array had failed the night before, and that morning IT informed the CEO that the payroll database was not included in the backups. This was a shock to the CEO because the payroll database had a lot of important information in it. The CEO was looking at possibly having to re-create the data in the payroll database from hard copies if the data could not be recovered. We were brought in to attempt that, but the situation could have been avoided if the right backup objects were selected.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Dependencies</h4>
<p class="noindent">Just having a backup is not always enough. You also need to have the dependencies necessary to restore that backup in an emergency. Dependencies include backup software, catalogs, decryption keys, and licensing.</p>
<p class="indent">Backup software is the first dependency. Each vendor stores its backup data in a different format. Usually, one vendor&#8217;s backup software cannot read the backup software of another vendor, so you will need to have the backup software that originally created the backup or a newer version of the software to perform the restore.</p>
<p class="indent">Catalogs are also necessary. Catalogs are indexes of the data on backup media or backup files. When you want to restore data, you may not know which file contains the data you are looking for, so you query the backup system, and it uses a catalog to find the file or media, and then you can load that media or select that file to do the restore. The good news is <span id="page_389" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>that you can catalog media or files if the catalog does not exist. However, if you have 1000 backup files that were pulled from an old backup drive, the backup software will need to catalog all of them for you to know what is on each one.</p>
<p class="text-icon"><img src="../Images/image01119.jpeg" width="58" height="40" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="text-icon1"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>A colleague needed to restore data from a backup at another site. The backup server there had crashed and local IT was currently rebuilding the server. The local IT sent over the backup files that were on the server, but the backup server at his site had never interacted with those files before, so he had to catalog all the files before he could find the data that needed to be restored. This added a bit of time to the restoration process.</p>
<p class="indent">Encryption is an important factor when storing backups. There may be many controls in place to protect data on production systems, but if backups are not encrypted, that data could be lost simply by exploiting the backup connection, backup media, or backup systems. For this reason, many companies encrypt their backups. To do the restore, you will need to provide the decryption keys, so keep these safe.</p>
<p class="indent">Licensing is also important. If you back up to a cloud service and then let the contract lapse, you will not be able to do a restore until you renew that license. Also, there is no guarantee that your backups will still be available if you let the contract lapse.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Connectivity</h4>
<p class="noindent">Backups, especially full ones, can take a lot of bandwidth depending on the size and type of the backup object. When migrating over a 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps Ethernet network, this is not as much of a concern, but bandwidth can be a huge constraint when performing backups over a low-speed WAN link such as a 5 Mbps MPLS connection.</p>
<p class="indent">Evaluate backup objects and their data sizes and then estimate how much time it will take to back them up over the bandwidth available. Be sure to factor in other traffic as well. You do not want the backup to impact normal business operations in the process.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Edge Sites</h4>
<p class="noindent">As information systems become more critical, companies are backing them up more often, even continuously. Latency can be an issue in ensuring timely backup completion when backing up to the cloud. The solution to latency with cloud backups is to select a vendor with edge sites close in proximity to the data that is being backed up. Edge sites are data centers closer to the customer.</p>
<p class="indent">Edge sites sometimes service requests and then synchronize back to the primary data center at a later time. Edge sites can also keep data close to the customer in their country of operation to meet data sovereignty requirements.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span id="page_390" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Equipment</h4>
<p class="noindent">You will need appropriate hardware to do the restore. If the data is on tape media, you will need a compatible tape device to do the restore. LTO drives can typically read two versions behind their stated version, and they can write to the stated version and one level down, so an LTO7 drive can read LTO 5, 6, and 7 and it can write to LTO 6 and 7.</p>
<p class="indent">You will also need enough storage space to do a restore. If you archived data to free up space but then later need it, you might need to purchase and install more storage first. You will also need enough bandwidth to copy down data from cloud backups.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Availability</h4>
<p class="noindent">It is very important to understand if the chosen backup requires downtime. Images of machines can sometimes fail when they are in use, so some image jobs are performed from boot disks when a server is offline.</p>
<p class="indent">Backups that require the system to be unavailable must be performed during a downtime. A downtime needs to be scheduled with stakeholders, such as end users and customers, and the stakeholders need to understand how long the downtime is anticipated to take.</p>
<p class="indent">If you anticipate performance degradation due to backups or restores, let stakeholders know. Some can adapt if they are aware of the issues, while some cannot, but they will at least know what is going on. A restore will likely be a higher priority than normal operations, but the helpdesk and other operations teams will need to be aware of the cause of the performance degradation.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Partners or Third Parties</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may use a third party or partner to perform backup services. The most common scenario is to use a cloud provider as the third-party backup service. It is important to understand your contact with the cloud vendor or other third party. Understand what their responsibilities are to you in the case of an emergency and how quickly data can be transferred from their site to yours.</p>
<p class="indent">If contracted IT performs backups for you, establish whether they will be available overnight or on weekends to perform emergency work if necessary. We know of one company that made the mistake of hiring a well-priced IT firm to manage its backups. The firm had two very knowledgeable people, but when the company needed a weekend restore, it learned that both IT people at the firm were out of town and unavailable.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Block-Level Backups and Transfers</h4>
<p class="noindent">Block-level backups reduce the time it takes to transfer data to the cloud. They are especially useful when dealing with large files. A block-level backup understands each of the individual blocks that make up the files in a backup set. When a file changes, the only data that is replicated to the cloud are the individual blocks that changed, rather than the entire file. A large 60GB file might be divided into many small 512KB blocks. A small change to the file would result in some of those blocks changing, and those alone would be replicated to the cloud.<span id="page_391" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch12lev310">Archiving</h4>
<p class="noindent">Archiving is another important function to reduce the costs of storage and backup operations. Organizations keep a lot of data, and some data is kept in the off chance that it is ever needed. This data does not need to reside on primary storage and can be moved to the cloud or to archival media instead, such as a hard drive, tape, optical media, or a flash drive. Cloud archiving options offer inexpensive ways to archive data to a data store that is available whenever users have an Internet connection. Cloud archiving options are best for portable machines such as laptops or mobile devices because they do not need to be connected to the corporate network to be archived. This preserves valuable organizational data for users on the go.</p>
<p class="indent">Local storage administrators should ensure that the media chosen is adequately protected against harm and that it is logged and cataloged so that it can be found if and when needed. Cloud backups should be verified periodically to ensure that data can be effectively retrieved in an acceptable amount of time.</p>
<h5 class="h5-gg" id="ch12lev311">CERTIFICATION SUMMARY</h5>
<hr class="hrg"/>
<p class="noindent">This chapter covered methods for protecting data and systems against issues that may come up such as mistakes, component failures, malicious activity, and disasters. Business continuity (BC) encompasses the activities that enable an organization to continue functioning, including offering services, delivering products, and conducting other activities deemed integral to running the business, during and following a disruptive incident.</p>
<p class="indent">Achieving a highly available computing environment is something that takes careful planning and consideration. There are multiple devices that need to be considered and multiple components in each device that need to be redundant and fault tolerant to achieve a highly available environment. High availability helps to prevent unplanned downtime and maintain service level agreements. An organization can set up a multisite configuration to have a hot site, warm site, or cold site so that in the event something happens to the primary data center the organization can migrate to a secondary data center and continue to operate.</p>
<p class="indent">Disaster recovery (DR) is the activities that are performed when a highly disruptive event occurs such as an outage for a complete site, fires, floods, or hurricanes. These events cause damage to information resources, facilities, and possibly personnel. A proper disaster recovery plan (DRP) can help an organization plan for and respond to a disaster through replication and restoration at alternate sites. Metrics such as the recovery time objective (RTO) and the recovery point objective (RPO) help organizations specify how much data can be lost and how long it should take to restore data and bring systems back to a functioning state. These decisions should be made based on the potential impact to the business so that impact is limited to acceptable levels.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter wrapped up by discussing backup and recovery. A backup set is a secondary copy of the organization&#8217;s data and is used to replace the original data in the event of a loss in a process known as restoration.<span id="page_392" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>

<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>recovery point objective (RPO)</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;The maximum amount of data might be lost due to a disaster. Restore operations essentially bring files back to a point in time. The point in time is when the last backup was taken, if that backup is available. Any data written after that backup or &#8220;point&#8221; would be lost so the RPO defines how much data can be lost.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>recovery time objective (RTO)</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;The maximum amount of time a system can be down after a failure or disaster.

RPO (recovery point objective) is the maximum acceptable amount of time that data might be lost due to a disaster. A BCP (business continuity plan) is a documented set of procedures and information about the organization that is collected and maintained so that the organization can continue operations in the event of a disaster. MTBF (mean time between failures) is the average length of time a hardware component will function before failing, usually measured in hours.</p>

Failback is the process of switching back to the primary site after the environment has been shifted to the backup site. A DRP (disaster recovery plan) is a documented set of procedures that defines how an organization can recover and protect its IT infrastructure in the event of a disaster. Redundancy is used to protect a primary system from failure by performing the operations of a backup system.</p>

A differential backup backs up all files that have changed since the last full backup and requires the latest differential and the last full backup to perform a restore. A full backup contains a complete copy of all files selected in the backup job. An image is an exact copy of a system at the time the image was taken.<span id="page_401" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>

A backup could be used to capture the state of a virtual machine if the administrator used a full backup, but the process takes considerably more time to complete than a snapshot and would not be the easiest method. An image is an exact copy of a system at the time the image was taken and would take a considerable amount of time. A clone would copy the entire contents of a disk to another disk but again would take a considerable amount of time, whereas a snapshot takes only a few seconds or minutes to complete.</p>
