<p class="noindent-d"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he objective of this study guide is to prepare you for the CompTIA Cloud+ (CV0-002) exam by familiarizing you with the technology and terminology tested on the exam. Because the primary focus of the book is to help you pass the exam, we don&#8217;t always cover every aspect of the related technology. Some aspects of the technology are covered only to the extent necessary to help you understand what you need to know to pass the exam, but we hope this book serves as a valuable professional resource long after the exam is over.</p>
<h3 class="h3">In This Book</h3>
<p class="noindent">This book is organized to serve as an in-depth review for the CompTIA Cloud+ exam for network administrators and cloud system engineers. Each chapter covers a major aspect of the exam, with an emphasis on the &#8220;why&#8221; as well as the &#8220;how to&#8221; of working with and implementing cloud technologies in a cloud-computing environment.</p>
<p class="indent">We have created a set of chapter components that call your attention to important items, reinforce key points, and provide helpful exam-taking hints. Take a look at what you will find in the chapters:</p>

The Certification Objective headings identify the objectives within the chapter.</p>

<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;The <strong>Self Test</strong> offers questions similar to those found on the exam. The answers to these questions, as well as explanations of the answers, can be found at the end of each chapter. By taking the Self Test after completing each chapter, you&#8217;ll reinforce what you&#8217;ve learned from that chapter while becoming familiar with the structure of the exam questions.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Exam Readiness Checklist</h3>
<p class="noindent">At the end of the Introduction, you will find the Exam Readiness Checklist. This table has been constructed to allow you to cross-reference the official exam objectives with the objectives as they are presented and covered in this book. This checklist also helps you gauge your level of expertise with each objective at the outset of your studies. This will allow you to check your progress and make sure you spend the time you need on more difficult or unfamiliar sections. The exam objectives are listed exactly as CompTIA presents them, and each objective has a cross-reference to the chapter, with the corresponding section of the study guide, that covers that objective.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Some Pointers</h3>
<p class="noindent">Once you&#8217;ve finished reading this book, set aside some time to do a thorough review. You might want to return to the book several times and make use of all the methods it offers for reviewing the material:</p>
<p class="numpt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Reread all the Two-Minute Drills</em> or have someone quiz you. You also can use the drills as a way to do a quick cram before the exam. You may want to make flash cards out of 3&#215;5 index cards with the Two-Minute Drill material.</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Reread all the Exam Watch notes and Exam at Work sidebars.</em> Remember that these notes are written by authors who have taken the exam and passed. They know what you should expect&#8212;and what you should be on the lookout for.</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Retake the Self Tests.</em> Taking the tests right after you&#8217;ve read the chapter is a good idea, because the questions help reinforce what you&#8217;ve just learned. However, it&#8217;s an even better idea to go back later and answer all the questions in the book in a single sitting. Pretend that you&#8217;re taking the live exam. When you go through the questions the first time, you should mark your answers on a separate piece of paper. That way, you can run through the questions as many times as you need to until you feel comfortable with the material.</p>
