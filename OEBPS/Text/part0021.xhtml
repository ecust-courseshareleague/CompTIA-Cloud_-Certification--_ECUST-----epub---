<p class="noindent-d"><span class="dropcap">M</span>any companies have combined the distinct functions of development (programming) and IT (operations) into a single group called DevOps. Instead of one team writing software and another deploying and supporting it, a single team is responsible for the entire life cycle. This has led to improved agility and a better responsiveness of DevOps teams to the issues faced by end users because the team works directly with them rather than one department removed. This chapter covers some DevOps functions including resource monitoring, remote access, and life cycle management.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_198" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Monitoring the cloud environment is a fundamental component of successful cloud computing environment management. Proper monitoring helps uncover problems early on, and it aids in detecting network outages quickly and efficiently, which leads to increased availability of servers, services, and applications. Valuable data obtained in monitoring metrics can be used to plan for future resource utilization and to become more proactive instead of reactive.</p>
<p class="indent">An organization needs to be able to monitor and manage the cloud environment quickly and efficiently. Remotely administering cloud virtualization is a flexible way to administer the environment and respond to issues or alerts that might arise. There are a variety of options for managing and monitoring the cloud environment securely and remotely, which are covered in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, organizations need to be able to manage the applications that they put in place. Life cycle management includes everything from the requirements stage to retirement. Each stage has inputs and outputs that connect the stages to one another. The application life cycle enables an organization to manage each of its service offerings as efficiently and effectively as possible and ensure that each of those services continues to provide value throughout its life cycle.</p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch7lev189">Resource Monitoring Techniques</h3>
<p class="noindent">Effective monitoring techniques provide an efficient means of monitoring all aspects of a cloud infrastructure without placing a significant performance burden on the systems and network. Monitoring techniques track the performance of enterprise systems and provide detailed information on the current usage of the cloud environment that can be consolidated and displayed on dashboards or reports.</p>
<p class="indent">Cloud computing provides an efficient way of load balancing, task scheduling, and allocating compute resources. Monitoring compute resources is an important part of maintaining a cloud environment and ensuring that systems have adequate resources to perform their tasks. Some key benefits of resource monitoring include providing input for chargebacks and showbacks, more intelligent resource provisioning and proactive resource expansion or contraction, more effective capacity planning, and improved technology agility in response to an ever-changing environment.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the goals of monitoring the environment is to ensure the overall health of key systems and applications. System health information can be published to a corporate intranet site, allowing the entire organization or select decision makers access to the health data. For example, an administrator might publish a dashboard on the company intranet site that shows the current service level agreements (SLAs) of the organization and whether or not the IT department has met those SLAs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_199" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Another place to use monitoring is in a chargeback situation. An IT department can monitor the environment and get a report on who consumed which compute resources and for how long, allowing the organization to charge departments for their use of compute resources.</p>
<p class="indent">The first part of understanding resource monitoring is to understand the protocols and methods used for resource monitoring, as discussed next. Then, this section discusses configuring baselines and thresholds and forecasting resource capacity. Finally, automation can be used to send alerts for specific events and thresholds, so this section concludes with a discussion on how that can be accomplished.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev190">Protocols and Methods</h4>
<p class="noindent">When defining a monitoring solution, it is important to understand the different protocols that are available for monitoring and the alerting options to problems that might arise in the cloud environment. Monitoring is enabled through a series of protocols and alerting methods that, in conjunction, can provide a robust system of threshold monitoring and alerting.</p>
<p class="indent">The following protocols and methods are presented in this section:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM)</p>

<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Syslog</p>
<h4 class="h4">SNMP</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the common protocols used to manage and monitor an environment is Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP is commonly supported on devices such as routers, switches, printers, and servers and is used to monitor these devices for issues or conditions that might arise on the devices that would require administrative attention.</p>
<p class="indent">A monitoring solution that uses SNMP has an administrative computer, commonly referred to as a manager, that monitors or manages a group of network devices. Each managed device runs an agent, which reports information, using SNMP, back to the manager. For example, an SNMP agent on a router can provide information about the router&#8217;s network configuration and operations (such as network interface configurations and routing tables) and transmit that information back to the manager.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a variety of vendors that use SNMP to monitor devices on the network; they use the information from SNMP to give an administrator a means of monitoring and managing network performance or reporting on and troubleshooting network issues. This knowledge enables administrators to better understand and prepare for network growth.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to monitoring and managing an environment, SNMP allows for alerts to be generated. An administrator can use SNMP to modify and apply new configurations to network devices and be alerted when certain conditions are present on monitored <span id="page_200" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>network devices. SNMP uses notifications, known as SNMP traps, to alert on important information. SNMP traps are network packets that contain data relating to a particular component of the network device running the SNMP agent; they can notify the management stations, by way of an unsolicited SNMP message, that a particular event has occurred. SNMP traps are triggered when particular preprogrammed conditions are present on the monitored device.</p>
<h4 class="h4">WMI</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another option for monitoring an environment is Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), Microsoft&#8217;s version of Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM). WBEM is an industry initiative to develop a standardized way of accessing management information in an enterprise environment.</p>
<p class="indent">WMI allows you to write scripts to automate certain administrative tasks and run those scripts against remote computers. WMI can query and set information on a workstation, server, application, or supported network device.</p>
<p class="indent">WMI provides a way to gather hardware information from multiple physical servers or virtual servers. WMI information can be placed into a centralized database, allowing for collection and reporting on a variety of information, including CPU, memory, operating system, and hard drive space.</p>

</div>
<div class="side1">
<p class="indent"><strong>WMI can be used to gather information about the installed software and the operating system version on a computer, along with hardware information.</strong></p>
</div>
<hr class="hr-si1" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/>
<p class="indent">WMI information can assist in determining if a system is close to maximizing compute resources, which may necessitate an upgrade to meet demands. For example, Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) uses WMI to gather hardware information from its clients and allows an administrator to manage and report on those systems based on the information gathered from the WMI queries.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Out-of-Band Management and IPMI</h4>
<p class="noindent">Out-of-band management allows an administrator to remotely manage and monitor a device using a separate network segment from normal production traffic. Out-of-band monitoring can be implemented with the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) protocol, which has the capability of monitoring a device that is not powered on. IPMI operates independently of the operating system, which allows BIOS settings to be remotely monitored or configured.</p>

<h4 class="h4"><span id="page_201" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Syslog</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the most common ways to gather event messages is with the use of syslog. Syslog is a logging standard that provides a mechanism for a network device to send event messages to a logging server or syslog server over UDP port 514 or TCP 514.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the benefits of a syslog server is that the syslog protocol is supported by a wide range of devices and can log different types of events. Syslog cannot poll devices to gather information as SNMP does; it simply gathers messages sent by various devices to a central syslog server when a specific event has triggered. Each device is configured with the location of the syslog collector and sends its logs to that server for collection. Syslog can be used to consolidate logs from multiple devices into a single location for review, analysis, or archival purposes. <a href="part0021.xhtml#ch7fig1">Figure 7-1</a> shows an example of a standard syslog server entry.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch7fig1"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 7-1</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;A sample syslog entry</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01167.jpeg" width="751" height="390" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="indent">After an organization chooses and configures its monitoring and alerting solution, its next step is to develop a baseline.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev191">Baselines and Thresholds</h4>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of establishing a baseline is to create a sample of resources that are being consumed by the cloud services, servers, or virtual machines over a set time period and to provide the organization with a point-in-time performance chart of its environment. Establish a baseline by selecting a sampling interval and the objects to monitor and then collecting performance data during that interval.</p>
<p class="indent">A good baseline must include an accurate sampling of normal activities. If the activity is roughly the same from week to week, then a baseline of one week might be sufficient. However, if activity fluctuates from week to week, the baseline would need to be longer. <span id="page_202" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>If a baseline were created for only a week and activity differed the next week, those differences would appear as outliers and be flagged as potential problems when they are actually just normal activity that was not captured in the baseline. However, do not go overboard on baseline collection, because a lengthy sampling interval can consume a significant amount of disk space and bandwidth.</p>
<p class="indent">Performance metrics collected when users report sluggish performance or slow response times can be easily compared to the baseline to see if performance is within normal tolerance. Continue to collect metrics at regular intervals to get a chart of how systems are consuming resources.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, if a user says that a database server is responding extremely slowly, the IT department can use a baseline to compare the performance of the server when it was performing well to when the user reported the slow performance.</p>
<p class="indent">Some software products such as VMware vCenter Operations Manager (VCOP) and Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) build an internal baseline over time. The baseline can be used to reveal patterns and outliers. For example, a cloud administrator may notice over a 12-month period that the average memory usage has increased 10 percent, which helps in planning additional resources for the server in the near future.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to establishing a baseline, an organization also needs to configure thresholds. When it comes to monitoring a cloud environment, thresholds are a key piece of the process. Thresholds can be set so that if a virtualization host consumes more than 95 percent of its CPU for more than 10 minutes, it sends an alert via either SMTP or SMS to the appropriate party (as described later in the chapter).</p>
<p class="indent">Setting a threshold allows for a more robust alerting system. Thresholds can also be used to automatically and dynamically create and orchestrate resources in the cloud computing environment. (&#8220;Orchestration&#8221; refers to automated tasks that could be scripted to happen based on particular conditions and triggers.)</p>
<p class="indent">Cloud computing allows a cloud consumer to define a threshold policy to check and manage resources when workload demands require. This allows the cloud provider to create instances of resources depending on how much the workload exceeds the threshold level. For example, a defined threshold could state that if CPU utilization for a particular virtual machine reaches 95 percent for 5 minutes, utilizing orchestration APIs, an additional processor should be added dynamically.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Target Object Baselines</h4>
<p class="noindent">Baselines should be collected not only for entire systems but also for objects within the system, such as CPU utilization, memory pages per second, CPU queue depth, memory utilization, data reads per second, data writes per second, and so forth. These values can be very useful in determining how to improve performance over time, optimize resources for utilization, and upgrade components so that they provide maximum value to the organization.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span id="page_203" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Target Anomalies</h4>
<p class="noindent">Baselines can be used to detect anomalies. Anomalies are events that are outside the norm. The baseline shows the norm, and the anomaly can indicate a short-term increase in utilization or a problem in the works. A pattern can be inferred from baseline data, and this pattern can be used to identify anomalous data collected thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Forecasting Resource Capacity</h4>
<p class="noindent">Baselining is useful in forecasting resource capacity and future utilization. Look at baseline values over time to perform a trend analysis. Some trends are based on the annual cycle, so it can be helpful to look at baselines over a 12-month period.</p>
<p class="indent">It is also useful to compare year-to-date numbers and compare corresponding months across years. Start tracking this data now and you will see how useful it will be later. Unfortunately, many companies wait to start collecting resource metrics until they urgently need answers. If you are not collecting data now, you will not have it available for analysis later when you need it so put such systems in place right away.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>Upsize/Increase</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Trends may show an increase or upsize over time. For example, if storage consumption was 100GB in January, 105GB in February, 109GB in March, 117GB in April, and 121GB in June, we can conclude that storage will need to increase a minimum of 5GB per month and that some months will increase more than that.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>Downsize/Decrease</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Conversely, trends may show a decrease over time. This could be due to efficiencies in the system or decreasing use of the application or system. For example, if memory consumption was 28GB in January, 24GB in February, 26GB in March, 22GB in April, and 23GB in June, we can conclude that storage will decrease about 2GB per month with a standard deviation of 4GB per month.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev192">Automated Event Responses</h4>
<p class="noindent">While monitoring and alerting are great ways to minimize problems in the cloud environment, there are some issues that arise with using these features. When an organization is monitoring and alerting on all its devices, the number of alerts that might arise could be staggering. If an administrator gets too many alerts, he may not have enough time to respond to those alerts and some issues may go unnoticed or may not be given the attention they deserve.</p>
<p class="indent">This is where automated event responses can help. For example, let&#8217;s say an administrator gets an alert that a hard drive is at 99 percent capacity. Instead of having to manually log into the server and delete files or run a disk cleanup program, the entire process can be scripted and executed by a trigger on the threshold. Once the threshold is hit, that triggers the script to run that performs the task. Automating minor tasks can save administrators <span id="page_204" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>considerable time and allow them to focus on more pressing issues. It also ensures that the tasks are carried out correctly and in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="text-icon"><img src="../Images/image01119.jpeg" width="58" height="40" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="text-icon1"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Recently we were brought in to help an organization manage its monitoring environment. We recommended the organization buy monitoring software that allows for automated responses. We configured thresholds and alerts based on the organization&#8217;s needs. We then configured the most common alerts with an automated response that would run a script to fix the issue and resolve the alert in the monitoring software.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Common Alert Methods/Messaging</h4>
<p class="noindent">An organization needs a way to be alerted when certain events occur. For example, if the organization is monitoring a server and that server loses network connectivity, IT administrators need to be notified of that occurrence so they can fix the issue that is causing the problem.</p>
<p class="indent">Many vendors offer network monitoring and alerting solutions both for on-premises and cloud-based deployments. Most vendors provide a website or some form of web service to monitor an organization&#8217;s cloud environment centrally, whether the cloud is private or public. The web service provides a dashboard that gives the administrator a quick and easy view of the entire cloud environment.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>SMTP</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the most common alerting methods used is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), discussed in <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4">Chapter 4</a>. When configured on a device, SMTP sends an e-mail when a monitored event occurs. The alert can be configured to send an e-mail to a single user or to a group of users so that more than one person receives the alert. SMTP is a quick and easy way of sending alerts from the monitoring software when certain events occur on the network.</p>
<p class="noind-gg"><span class="bign"><strong>SMS</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Another option for receiving alerts is the Short Message Service (SMS), a text messaging service that allows an alert to be sent to a mobile device. The use of SMS is a great way to notify an on-call technician when an alert has been generated after hours. Monitoring an environment is normally a 24-hour job because the network needs to be available 24 hours a day.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Alerting Based on Deviation from Baseline</h4>
<p class="noindent">It is important to save baseline data. You can use simple spreadsheets, but a database is the best way to save such data because it allows you to write queries to analyze the data in different ways. As you gather the data, configure alerts to let administrators know of significant deviations from the baseline. Resources may need to be adjusted to handle short-term spikes in demand, or this could indicate the start of a new trend. Either way, it is important to be aware of these changes as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_205" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Alerts can be configured such that when metrics are a certain percentage above the baseline, an alert is sent to a specific individual or a distribution group. For example, you may want to send out an alert if CPU utilization is 40 percent more than average for a sustained duration of at least ten minutes. You can also configure alerts to go out when certain static thresholds are met. For example, you may plan to expand a LUN when it reaches 100GB, so you set an alert that notifies you when the LUN reaches that point.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Policies to Communicate Events Properly</h4>
<p class="noindent">Metrics are not the only thing that should prompt alerting. Some events require immediate attention. These events cannot wait until an administrator reviews the logs. For such cases, policies should be created defining which events require notification and how administrators should respond to such alerts. For example, the policy may state that a critical event requires immediate notification to the on-call administrators and that administrators must respond to the event within five minutes and resolve the event within one hour.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the policy is defined, technical controls can be implemented to carry out the policy. Triggers can be created to alert on such events to a person or group right away, and systems can be put in place to track resolution time and who is on call.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Event Collection and Event Collection Policies</h4>
<p class="noindent">A server can consume a lot of space with event logs. All too often companies configure small log sizes with rollover so that new events automatically replace old ones. However, these same companies often find out too late that the events they need to see have already been overwritten.</p>
<p class="indent">Establish policies to ensure that events are retained for a sufficiently long period of time. Your data retention policy is a good place to start. A good retention rate for logs is 18 months. This can consume a lot of space on the local machine, so it is a best practice to archive logs off to lower-cost secondary storage or to a log review platform. A log review platform can also centralize log review, log analysis, and alerting functions, simplifying the entire event management process.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Event Correlation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Events can reveal a lot of data in and of themselves, but they are immensely more valuable when correlated with events from other network devices. Networked machines do not operate in a vacuum, so log review should also take into consideration other devices when investigating issues or detecting threats.</p>
<p class="indent">Event correlation can combine authentication requests from domain controllers, incoming packets from perimeter devices, and data requests from application servers to gain a more complete picture of what is going on. Software exists to automate much of the process. Such software, called security information and event management (SIEM), archives logs and reviews the logs in real time against correlation rules to identify possible threats or problems. Additionally, baselines and heuristics can identify issues that crop up before they turn into <span id="page_206" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>bigger issues. For example, a number of informational events, when analyzed together, may present a bigger issue that can be resolved before it creates problems for end users. Without such a system, administrators likely would not notice the events until errors or warnings appeared in the log, which would probably be the same time that users of the system also experience issues.</p>
<p class="indent">It is much easier to fix an issue when end users are not complaining about the issue. IT administrators tend to think more clearly and logically when not under pressure. SIEM can change the way IT administrators investigate issues, eventually causing them to focus more on proactive indicators of an issue rather than reactively fighting fires.</p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch7lev193">Remote-Access Tools</h3>
<p class="noindent">The computing environment is often is a different location from the working environment because of the environmental needs servers have and the economies of scale that can be achieved by housing thousands of servers in the same place. For cloud servers, the cloud customer might not even know where the server is being hosted. Both scenarios depend upon remote access to manage, service, and maintain systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Remotely accessing a server does not always have to mean accessing the server from an offsite location. There are times when simply connecting to a host computer or virtual machine from a workstation is more convenient than physically walking over to the server and logging in. When a quick fix or change needs to be made to a virtual machine or host computer, being able to access that server from a local workstation saves time and prevents the need to walk or drive to the data center and physically sit at the machine that requires the change.</p>
<p class="indent">Being able to remotely access and troubleshoot a virtualization host or virtual machine requires less time and makes fixing and maintaining the environment easier to accomplish. Some remote-access tools include remote hypervisor access and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev194">Remote Hypervisor Access</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are a variety of ways to remotely connect to a hypervisor. Most vendors allow a console to be installed on a workstation or server that is not the hypervisor. This allows a user to manage the hypervisor from their workstation. The machine with the remote management tools on it is often referred to as a jump or step machine. Multiple hypervisors can be managed from a single console on a workstation, giving a single-pane-of-glass approach to hypervisor management.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_207" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Remote hypervisor tools enable administrators to perform most of the tasks for the hypervisor as if they were connecting directly to the actual hypervisor host. The client console gives them the ability to create or modify virtual machines or virtual hard disks, configure virtual machine settings, and so on. This allows them to do all the administrative tasks that are required on a day-to-day basis from a single workstation.</p>
<p class="indent">Users of remote hypervisor tools need to have the correct administrative permissions on the hypervisor to modify the settings for the host computer or the virtual machines. Using a console from a workstation is an excellent way to connect to a hypervisor host because it looks and acts just as it would if the user were locally logged into the hypervisor host.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev195">RDP</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) differs from installing the hypervisor console on a workstation in that RDP allows for remotely connecting and logging into the desktop of the hypervisor host. RDP provides remote display and input capabilities over the network. RDP connections are made through software that supports RDP over TCP port 3389. RDP is built into Windows machines and can be executed by typing mstsc from the command prompt or run command. <a href="part0021.xhtml#ch7fig2">Figure 7-2</a> shows an example of RDP client software that is used to connect to a hypervisor host remotely. RDP is a multichannel protocol that provides separate virtual channels for transmitting device communication and presentation data from the server.</p>

<p class="noindent">Recently we were brought into an organization that had deployed multiple hypervisor hosts in its environment. The organization had a total of 20 hypervisor hosts and 250 virtual machines. The data center that the hypervisor hosts were installed on was in an adjacent building, and the time it took administrators to walk to the data center was time that they could have spent doing other tasks. The organization needed a way to centrally manage the hosts from the administrators&#8217; workstation computers without having to log into each one individually.</p>
<p class="indent">The solution was to install the console on each of the administrators&#8217; workstations and add the hypervisor hosts into the single console. This allowed each administrator not only to see all 20 of the hypervisor host computers, but manage those hosts as well. It was a great solution that satisfied all of the organization&#8217;s needs by saving the administrators&#8217; time and effort and allowing them to manage all 20 hypervisor hosts from a single console. The console that is installed on each workstation looks and responds just like the console that is installed on the hypervisor host computer.</p>

<p class="indent"><span id="page_208" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>The advantage of using RDP to connect to a hypervisor is that the user has direct access to the hypervisor server without having to be physically sitting at the hypervisor host. RDP allows a user to interact with the server just as if they were sitting in front of it. So instead of just having access to the hypervisor console, RDP enables access to the entire server. The user can launch other applications on the server as well as change system settings on the hypervisor host computer itself. RDP allows for complete control of the server operating system, not just the hypervisor settings, without having to be at the hypervisor host computer physically.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the disadvantages of using RDP for managing a virtualization environment is that an administrator cannot manage multiple hypervisor hosts in a single RDP session like she can with a remote hypervisor client console. The option to use RDP is currently only available for the Microsoft hypervisor. Connections made to other modern hypervisors such as VMware, Citrix, and Oracle require the use of a software client installed on a jump machine.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev196">Console Port</h4>
<p class="noindent">A console port allows an administrator to use a cable to connect directly to a hypervisor host computer or a virtual machine. The administrator can use a parallel or serial port to connect peripherals to a virtual machine and can add serial ports and change the logical COM port configuration. The virtual serial port can connect to a physical serial port or to a file on the <span id="page_209" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>host computer. Using a console port allows for managing a virtualization host computer directly from another computer connected to the host computer with a console cable.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev197">SSH</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol provides a secure way to manage network devices, including hypervisor hosts, remotely. SSH uses public key cryptography to exchange a symmetric key covertly between the SSH client and the SSH server, creating a fast and secure channel and then using that channel to authenticate a remote computer and user if required.</p>
<p class="indent">SSH can use a manually generated public&#8211;private key pair to perform authentication. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the connection. SSH can be used to log into a remote computer and execute certain command strings against a hypervisor host machine.</p>
<p class="indent">SSH provides strong authentication if using the latest version and secure communication over an insecure channel. It was designed to replace remote shell (RSH) and Telnet because RSH and Telnet send unencrypted traffic over the network, making them insecure communication methods.</p>
<p class="indent">When designing a virtualization environment, it is not recommended to have the hypervisor host directly exposed to the Internet. Normally the hypervisor host is installed behind a firewall or some other form of protection, which makes it difficult to access the hypervisor host off-site. SSH allows for the creation of a secure management tunnel to the hypervisor host computer or virtual machine and provides a secure way to manage those devices since all the traffic is sent through an encrypted tunnel.</p>

<hr class="hr-si1" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev198">HTTP</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another option for remotely accessing a hypervisor host machine is through a web console that is using HTTP or HTTPS. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol built on TCP used to distribute Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files, text, images, sound, videos, multimedia, and other types of information over the Internet. HTTP typically allows for communication between a web client or web browser and a web server hosting a website. Most hypervisor vendors have a web console that allows an administrator to access a hypervisor host from virtually anywhere as long as the DNS name of the hypervisor can be resolved, and HTTPS access is allowed through perimeter devices.</p>
<p class="indent">Administrators may have to install an additional component when doing the initial hypervisor host installation in order to provide web access to a host computer. The hypervisor host web service should be configured to use HTTPS to ensure a secure way to connect to it. Some hypervisors (like Microsoft IIS) may require additional software on the host computer as well. Connecting to a hypervisor host computer using a web console is a quick and easy way to perform simple configuration on a virtual machine.<span id="page_210" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch7lev199">Life Cycle Management</h3>
<p class="noindent">Life cycle management is the process or processes put in place by an organization to assist in the management, coordination, control, delivery, and support of its configuration items from the requirements stage to retirement. The core of this is the application life cycle, or software development life cycle (SDLC). Additionally, ITIL has established a framework for implementing life cycle management, and Microsoft has a framework that is based on ITIL.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these frameworks, DevOps professionals should understand the functions involved in application replacement, retirement, migration, and changes in feature use. Business needs may also change, requiring changes to the application or retirement of the application.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev200">Application Life Cycle</h4>
<p class="noindent">Just as creatures are born and eventually die, applications are created and eventually retired. This process is called the application life cycle. The application life cycle consists of five phases: specifications, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. <a href="part0021.xhtml#ch7fig3">Figure 7-3</a> shows the application life cycle.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch7fig3"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 7-3</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Application life cycle</p>

</div>
<div class="side1">
<p class="indent"><strong>No official version of the SDLC exists. There are several versions, some of which have six, seven, or even ten phases. However, each version still covers the same things, just more or less granularly. It is important to understand the things that are taking place in the process, no matter how many phases are described.</strong></p>
</div>
<hr class="hr-si1" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/>
<h4 class="h4"><span id="page_211" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Phase 1: Specifications</h4>
<p class="noindent">The first phase of the application life cycle is the specifications phase. In this phase, the application&#8217;s reason for being is documented. Users and stakeholders explain what they would like the application to do and what problem it will solve for them.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Phase 2: Development</h4>
<p class="noindent">In the development phase, project managers turn specifications into a model for a working program. They map out the requirements for different discrete tasks with the idea of creating the smallest discrete code that can be tested and validated. In this way, when bugs or flaws are identified, it is easy to pinpoint where they came from. Those tasks are assigned to developers who write that segment.</p>
<p class="indent">Developers write code for the current section of the program that has been designed. Only small parts of the code are written at a time to keep everything as simple to manage as possible. The more complex the code, the greater the chance that bugs will pop up.</p>
<p class="indent">Software code is made up of modules that contain functions and procedures. Within these functions and procedures, the elements of code are written. These include variables that store a value; classes that define program concepts containing properties and attributes; Boolean operations such as AND, OR, and NOR; looping functions that repeat sections of code; and sorting and searching functions.</p>
<p class="indent">Developers write code in an integrated development environment (IDE) that can check syntax of code similar to how spell checking works in a word processing application. Code is written in a selected language and each of the developers will use the same language when writing a program together.</p>
<p class="indent">Each time a change is made to the code, the developers publish the new code to a code repository, a program that tracks code changes. This phase continues until all the elements required in the specifications have been created in the program. Developers do some initial testing on the functions they create to ensure that they perform as they were designed to do. Once enough programming elements are gathered together to create a release, they are passed on to the testing phase.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Phase 3: Testing</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this phase, the code developed in the development phase is subjected to testing to ensure that it performs according to specifications, without errors, bugs, or security issues. Development code should never be ported directly to the production environment because developers may not be aware of bugs or other problems with the code that the testing phase can reveal. Testers may be other developers or their full job may be in testing code. Either way, they are members of the DevOps team and an overall part of delivering the program.</p>
<p class="indent">Code is typically deployed to a development environment where the developed application is subjected to automated testing and individual testing by users and groups. This occurs for each distinct element that is coded so that errors can be identified and isolated. Most integrated development environments (IDEs) have built-in syntax checking, variable validation, and autocomplete to help keep the majority of typos from causing problems.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_212" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Some development environments exist locally on the developer&#8217;s machine. This streamlines the process for deploying code changes, and code can be executed in the development environment with breakpoints and other objects to find errors and monitor the details of program execution.</p>
<p class="indent">Once code is stable in the development environment, it is moved to a staging or quality assurance (QA) environment. This is when quality assurance kicks in: testers go to staging servers and verify that the code works as intended.</p>
<p class="indent">The staging environment needs to be provisioned, or the existing environment needs to be made current. This includes making the patch level consistent with the production environment and installing add-ons or configuration changes that have been made in production since the last release. Testers use information from the change management database on recent production changes to obtain a list of changes to be made in the QA environment.</p>
<p class="indent">The testing phase should include people involved in the specifications phase to ensure that the specifications were correctly translated into an application. When bugs or issues are identified with the application, developers fix those issues until the application is ready to be deployed into production.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, procedures should be documented for how the system will be deployed and used. Deployment documentation will be used in phase 4 and user documentation will be used to train users on how to use the program and its new features properly. Documentation should also include a brief list of updates that can be distributed to users for reference.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Phase 4: Deployment</h4>
<p class="noindent">In the deployment phase, the application developed and tested in previous phases is installed and configured in production for stakeholders to use. The first step is to ensure that the resources required for the application deployment are available, including compute, memory, and storage resources, as well as personnel. Teams may need to provision or deprovision cloud resources. Only then, can the remainder of the deployment be scheduled.</p>
<p class="indent">It can be tempting to automate this process. However, deployment needs to be performed by a human, and at a time when others are available to troubleshoot if necessary. Automatic deployments can lead to issues, particularly if someone accidentally triggers an automatic deployment to production.</p>
<p class="indent">Developers should do a final check of their code in this phase to remove testing elements such as debugger breakpoints and performance hogs such as verbose logging. Then, project managers work with stakeholders and customers to identify an ideal time to do the deployment. They need to select a time that is convenient for the DevOps team and one that does not fall in peak times of when customers have urgent need of the application. DevOps teams may be deploying application releases every other week so they may need to have a regularly scheduled downtime for this. Other options include blue-green deployments where the site is deployed and tested and then a switch is quickly made to make that site live with minimal disruption to the user base. See <a href="part0023.xhtml#ch9">Chapter 9</a> for more information on deployment methodologies.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_213" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>It is critical to take a backup or snapshots of the application servers before rolling out the new version. Despite all the testing in the previous phase, problems still can arise, and you will want to have a good clean version to go back to if a problem arises.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes issues are encountered when deploying to production, despite the testing that occurred in previous phases of the application life cycle. In such cases, DevOps teams may need to roll back to the snapshot if they cannot fix the deployment issues in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the application is deployed, users need to be trained on the new features or changes of the release. This could be as simple as sending out release notes or including links to video tutorials and bundling tool tips into the application, or it could be more involved such as requiring one-on-one training.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Phase 5: Maintenance</h4>
<p class="noindent">Along the way after deployment, various patches will be required to keep the application, or the resources it relies upon, functioning properly. This phase is called the maintenance phase. Here the DevOps team will fix small user-reported bugs or configuration issues, field tickets from users, and measure and tweak performance to keep the application running smoothly.</p>
<p class="indent">There is an element of maintenance that involves a micro version of the entire application life cycle, because small issues will result in specifications, which will lead to development and testing, and ultimately deployment into the production environment. Some of the tasks listed previously fall into this category. Suffice to say, this element is somewhat recursive.</p>
<p class="indent">Before adding new code, changing code, or performing other maintenance tasks that might impact application availability, the DevOps team works with stakeholders and customers to identify an ideal time to perform the activity. Some deployments may be urgent, such as fixes to address a critical vulnerability that was just discovered or a serious issue that users or customers are experiencing. In these cases, these limitations may be waived due to the criticality of the update.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to note the difference between patches and releases here. Releases offer new features while patches fix bugs or security problems.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev201">ITIL</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) provides a framework for implementing life cycle management. ITIL&#8217;s model for life cycle management is a continuum consisting of the following five phases:</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Service strategy</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Service design</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Service transition</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Service operation</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Continual service improvement</p>
<p class="indentt"><span id="page_214" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Each phase has inputs and outputs that connect the stages to one another, and continual improvement is recognized via multiple trips through the life cycle. Each time through, improvements are documented and then implemented based on feedback from each of the life cycle phases. These improvements enable the organization to execute each of its service offerings as efficiently and effectively as possible and ensure that each of those services provides as much value to its users as possible.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Microsoft Operations Framework</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Microsoft Operations Framework (MOF) is based on ITIL. MOF has shortened the life cycle to four phases:</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Plan</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Deliver</p>
<p class="nums"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Operate</p>

<p class="indentt">These phases are usually depicted graphically in a continuum, as we see in <a href="part0021.xhtml#ch7fig4">Figure 7-4</a>. This continuum represents the cyclical nature of process improvement, with a structured system of inputs and outputs that leads to continual improvement.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch7fig4"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 7-4</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;A representation of the MOF life cycle continuum</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01170.jpeg" width="321" height="321" alt="Images"/></p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev202">Application Replacement</h4>
<p class="noindent">Eventually, the application reaches a point where significant changes are required to make it useful. This could be due to shifts in the environment, in other business processes, or in the underlying technology that the application was built upon. At this point, specifications are drafted for a replacement application or a newer version of the application, and the cycle begins anew.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev203"><span id="page_215" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Application Retirement</h4>
<p class="noindent">All applications eventually reach a point where they no longer provide value to the organization. At this point, the application should be retired. Program code and processes are documented and the resources the application uses are released for some other purpose.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev204">Application Migration</h4>
<p class="noindent">Applications may need to be migrated to different hardware as their usage increases or decreases. The application may need to be migrated as the underlying technology environment changes. For example, the organization may move to more powerful hardware or from one cloud provider to another or from one virtualization platform to a competing platform.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev205">Application Feature Use (Increase/Decrease)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Use of an application will change over time. Application use will be relatively limited as it is introduced because it takes a while for users to adopt a new solution. However, as the value of the program is demonstrated and more people tell others about it, the use will gradually increase. Eventually, application use will plateau and stay at a relatively consistent level for some time before it finally diminishes when other applications or newer processes supplant the application or as business conditions change.</p>
<p class="indent">A major thing touted in new releases is what new features the release adds.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch7lev206">Business Needs Change</h4>
<p class="noindent">Business needs change, sometimes quite rapidly. Business change can be frustrating for application developers who have spent much time putting an application together, hoping that it will have a long shelf life. However, businesses must adapt to their environment and meet continually changing customer needs and wants. Adaptation necessitates changes to applications, tools, systems, and personnel to adjust the technology environment to these new requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">Cloud technologies make such changes much easier. Cloud services can be expanded, contracted, or terminated simply by contacting the cloud vendor and requesting the change. Some services may have a contract period, with a penalty for breaking the contact, but many services are flexible.</p>
<p class="indent">It is also important to note that personnel changes are not as dramatic when using cloud services. If a company decides to stop using one cloud service and adopt two others, this might result in no changes to personnel. By contrast, if these were on-premises applications, one person might need to go through training to be familiar with the new application and another person may need to be hired to support the new one.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_216" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Some business changes that impact cloud professionals include</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Cloud service requirement changes</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Regulatory and legal changes</p>
<h4 class="h4">Mergers, Acquisitions, and Divestitures</h4>
<p class="noindent">When two companies decide to combine their businesses, this is known as a merger. One company can also choose to purchase another in an acquisition. Some companies decide to change direction and sell off a portion of their business through a divestiture.</p>
<p class="indent">Every company has a unique technology infrastructure that supports its business, and any company that goes through a merger, acquisition, or divestiture has to adapt its infrastructure to meet the requirements of the new corporate form. Physical hardware must be moved from one site to another, possibly rebranded, and adapted to meet the policies, standards, and compliance requirements of the new company.</p>
<p class="indent">Cloud services streamline this operation. Cloud accounts can be moved from one company to another and still reside with the same provider. Cloud integrations can be migrated from one system to another if necessary. Cloud migrations are easiest if cloud service integrations were performed using standard APIs.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Cloud Service Requirement Changes</h4>
<p class="noindent">Cloud service providers are continually upgrading their systems to take advantage of new technologies and improvements in processes. Unlike on-premises solutions where new software versions must be deployed by IT staff, cloud updates are deployed by the cloud provider on the organization&#8217;s behalf. It is important to stay on top of what changes are made by the cloud provider in case changes are needed on the organizational side as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Companies may also request changes to their cloud services. In some cases, a cloud provider might offer a buffet of services, and customers can add or remove these services at will. Other solutions may be highly customized for the customer, in which case negotiation with the provider and adequate lead time are necessary for changes to be made to the environment to meet the customer requirements.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Regulatory and Legal Changes</h4>
<p class="noindent">The regulatory and legal environment is also an area that sees frequent change. When a country promulgates a new regulation or law (or changes an existing one) that affects business practices, companies that do business in that country must adhere to the new or changed law or regulation. Global organizations often have entire teams of people who monitor changes in the global regulatory environment and then work with organizational departments to implement appropriate changes.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_217" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Corporate legal teams often work with vendor management or IT to coordinate with cloud providers to ensure that legal and regulatory requirements are met. One way to validate that a cloud provider supports new regulatory requirements is through a vendor risk assessment. This involves sending a document listing each of the requirements to the cloud provider and asking the cloud provider to verify that it has the appropriate controls and measures in place to meet the compliance requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">Vendor risk assessments take time to administer and time to complete. It is important to give vendors plenty of time to work through the details. Some vendors will need to implement additional procedures or controls to meet the requirements, and others may decide that they do not want to make changes, forcing your organization to move its business from one cloud provider to another to remain compliant.</p>
<h5 class="h5-gg" id="ch7lev207">CERTIFICATION SUMMARY</h5>
<hr class="hrg"/>
<p class="noindent">Monitoring the network is a key component of DevOps and cloud computing. Monitoring allows an organization to plan for future resource utilization and respond to issues that arise in the cloud environment. Combining monitoring and alerting gives an administrator a way to be proactive instead of reactive when it comes to the cloud environment.</p>
<p class="indent">Remotely managing the virtualization environment provides flexibility and ease of administration. Being able to control multiple virtualization host computers from a single console saves time and makes managing the cloud environment an easier task.</p>
<p class="indent">Life cycle management is the process or processes put in place by an organization to assist in the management, coordination, control, delivery, and support of its configuration items from the requirements stage to retirement. The core of this is the application life cycle, or software development life cycle (SDLC).
