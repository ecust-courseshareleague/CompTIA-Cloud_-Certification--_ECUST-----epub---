<h3 class="h3" id="applev364">About the Total Tester</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Total Tester provides you with a simulation of the CompTIA Cloud+ CV0-002 exam. Exams can be taken in Practice Mode, Exam Mode, or Custom Mode. Practice Mode provides an assistance window with hints, references to the book, explanations of the correct and incorrect answers, and the option to check your answer as you take the test. Exam Mode provides a simulation of the actual exam. The number of questions, the types of questions, and the time allowed are intended to be an accurate representation of the exam environment. Custom Mode allows you to create custom exams from selected domains or chapters, and you can further customize the number of questions and time allowed.</p>
<p class="indent">To take a test, launch the program and select Cloud+ SG2 from the Installed Question Packs list. You can then select Practice Mode, Exam Mode, or Custom Mode. All exams provide an overall grade and a grade broken down by domain.</p>
