<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch4lev97">Network Types</h3>
<p class="noindent">A network is defined as a group of interconnected computers and peripherals that are capable of sharing resources, including software, hardware, and files. The purpose of a network is to provide users with access to information that multiple people might need to perform their day-to-day job functions.</p>
<p class="indent">There are numerous advantages for an organization to construct a network. It allows users to share files so that multiple users can access them from a single location. An organization can share resources such as printers, fax machines, storage devices, and even scanners, thus reducing the total number of resources they have to purchase and maintain. A network also allows for applications to be shared by multiple users as long as the application is designed for this and the appropriate software licensing is in place.</p>
<p class="indent">There are three types of networks: intranet, Internet, and extranet. They all rely on the same Internet protocols but have different levels of access for users inside and outside the organization. This section describes each of these network types and when to use them.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev98">Intranet</h4>
<p class="noindent">An intranet is a private network based on the Internet Protocol (IP) that is configured and controlled by a single organization and is only accessible to users that are internal to that particular organization. An intranet can host multiple private websites and is usually the focal point for internal communication and collaboration.</p>
<p class="indent">An intranet allows an organization to share information and websites within the organization and is protected from external access by a firewall or a network gateway. <span id="page_91" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>For example, an organization may want to share announcements, the employee handbook, confidential financial information, or organizational procedures with its employees but not with people outside the organization.</p>
<p class="indent">An intranet is very similar to the Internet except an intranet is restricted to specific users. For example, a web page that is designed for the intranet may have a similar look and feel like any other website that is on the Internet, the only difference being who is authorized to access the web page. Public web pages that are accessible over the Internet are typically available to everyone, whereas an intranet is owned and controlled by the organization and that organization decides who can access that web page. <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4fig1">Figure 4-1</a> shows an example of an intranet configuration.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch4fig1"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 4-1</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;An intranet network configuration, where access is private</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01143.jpeg" width="512" height="284" alt="Images"/></p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev99">Internet</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the same Internet protocols (TCP/IP) as an intranet network uses. Unlike an intranet, which is controlled by and serves only one organization, the Internet is not controlled by a single organization and serves billions of users around the world. The Internet is a network of multiple networks relying on network devices and common protocols to transfer data from one intermediate destination (sometimes called a hop) to another until it reaches its final destination.</p>
<p class="indent">Aside from a few countries that impose restrictions on what people in their country can view, the Internet is largely unregulated, and anyone can post or read whatever they want on the Internet. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a nonprofit organization that was created to coordinate the Internet&#8217;s system of unique identifiers, including domain names and IP addresses.<span id="page_92" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev100">Extranet</h4>
<p class="noindent">An extranet is an extension of an Intranet, with the primary difference that an extranet allows controlled access from outside the organization. An extranet permits access to outside users with the use of firewalls, access profiles, and privacy protocols. It allows an organization to share resources with other businesses securely. For example, an organization could use an extranet to sell its products and services online or to share information with business partners.</p>

</div>
<hr class="hr-si1" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/>
<p class="indent">Both intranets and extranets are owned and supported by a single organization. The way to differentiate between an intranet and an extranet is by who has access to the private network and the geographical reach of that network. <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4fig2">Figure 4-2</a> shows an example configuration of an extranet network.</p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch4lev101">Network Optimization</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you know about the different types of networks, you need to understand the components of those networks and how they can be optimized. In this section, you will learn about the components that make up intranet and extranet networks and how to configure them so that they perform most efficiently.</p>
<p class="indent">Network optimization is the process of keeping a network operating at peak efficiency. To keep the network running at peak performance, an administrator must perform a variety <span id="page_93" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>of tasks, including updating the firmware and operating system on routers and switches, identifying and resolving data flow bottlenecks, and monitoring network utilization. By keeping the network optimized, a network administrator as well as cloud providers can more accurately meet the terms of the organization&#8217;s SLA.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev102">Network Scope</h4>
<p class="noindent">The scope of a network defines its boundaries. The largest network on Earth was described earlier. It is the Internet, but millions of other networks span organizational or regional boundaries. The terms LAN, MAN, and WAN are used to differentiate these networks.</p>
<h4 class="h4">LAN</h4>
<p class="noindent">A local area network (LAN) is a network topology that spans a relatively small area like an office building. A LAN is a great way for people to share files, devices, pictures, and applications and is primarily Ethernet based.</p>
<p class="indent">There are three different data rates of modern Ethernet networks:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Fast Ethernet</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;Transfers data at a rate of 100 Mbps (megabits per second)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;Transfers data at 1,000 Mbps</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>10 Gigabit Ethernet</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;Transfers data at 10,000 Mbps</p>
<h4 class="h4">MAN</h4>
<p class="noindent">A metropolitan area network (MAN) is very similar to a LAN except that a MAN spans a city or a large campus. A MAN usually connects multiple LANs and is used to build networks with high data connection speeds for cities or college campuses. MANs are efficient and fast because they use high-speed data carriers such as fiber optics.</p>
<h4 class="h4">WAN</h4>
<p class="noindent">A wide area network (WAN) is a network that covers a large geographic area and can contain multiple LANs or MANs. WANs are not restricted by geographic areas. The Internet is an example of the largest WAN. Some corporations use leased lines to create a corporate WAN that spans a large geographic area containing locations in multiple states or even countries.</p>
<p class="text-icon"><img src="../Images/image01119.jpeg" width="58" height="40" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="text-icon1"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><strong>Working for a large organization with regional offices all across the United States, we were tasked with setting up a WAN. The company&#8217;s offices ranged from 5 to 100 or more employees. To accommodate their needs, we set up a VPN connection using leased Internet lines at each location to connect into a central data center. This allowed every employee to connect into the data center and share resources no matter where their physical location.</strong><span id="page_94" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev103">Network Topologies</h4>
<p class="noindent">How the different nodes, or devices, in a network are connected and how they communicate is determined by the network&#8217;s topology. The network topology is the blueprint of the connections of a computer network and can be either physical or logical. Physical topology refers to the design of the network&#8217;s physical components: computers, switches, cable installation, and so on. Logical topology can be thought of as a picture of how the data flows within a network.</p>
<p class="indent">As an IT professional, you need to understand the pros and cons of the different network topologies when you are building and designing a network. After evaluating the needs of the organization, you can then choose the most efficient topology for the intended purpose of the network. The primary physical topologies to be considered are bus, star, ring, mesh, and tree.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Bus</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a bus topology, every node is connected to a central cable, referred to as the bus or backbone. In a bus topology, only one device is allowed to transmit at any given time. Since a bus topology uses a single cable, it is easy to set up and cost-effective.</p>
<p class="indent">The bus topology is not recommended for large networks because of the limitations to the number of nodes that can be configured on a single cable. Troubleshooting a bus topology is much more difficult than troubleshooting a star topology because in a bus topology you have to determine where the cable was broken or removed. In a star topology, the central device offers a simple place to conduct troubleshooting. <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4fig3">Figure 4-3</a> shows an example of a network configured to use a bus topology.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch4fig3"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 4-3</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Network configuration using a bus topology</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01145.jpeg" width="599" height="168" alt="Images"/></p>
<h4 class="h4">Star</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a star topology, each node is connected to a central hub or switch, and the nodes communicate by sending data through the central hub. In a star topology, new nodes can easily be added or removed without impacting the rest of the nodes on the network.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_95" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>The star topology offers improved performance over a bus topology. The star topology is also more resilient than a bus topology because failure of one node does not affect the rest of the network. Problematic nodes can be easily isolated by unplugging that particular node; if the problem disappears, it can be concluded that it is related to that node, making troubleshooting much simpler in a star topology.</p>
<p class="indent">The main drawback to the star topology is that if the central hub or switch fails, all the nodes connected to it are disconnected and unable to communicate with the other nodes. <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4fig4">Figure 4-4</a> shows an example of a network configured to use a star topology.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch4fig4"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 4-4</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Network configuration using a star topology</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01146.jpeg" width="520" height="559" alt="Images"/></p>
<h4 class="h4">Ring</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a ring topology, each node is connected to another, forming a circle or a ring. Each packet is sent around the ring until it reaches its target destination. The ring topology is hardly used in today&#8217;s enterprise environment because all network connectivity is lost if one of the links in the network path is broken. <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4fig5">Figure 4-5</a> shows an example of a network configured to use a ring topology.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch4fig5"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 4-5</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Network configuration using a ring topology</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01147.jpeg" width="501" height="531" alt="Images"/></p>
<h4 class="h4"><span id="page_96" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Mesh</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a true mesh topology, every node is interconnected to every other node in the network, allowing transmissions to be distributed even if one of the connections goes down. A mesh topology is, however, difficult to configure and expensive to implement and is not commonly used. It is the most fault tolerant of the physical topologies, but it requires the most amount of cable. Since cabling is expensive, the cost must be weighed against the fault tolerance achieved. <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4fig6">Figure 4-6</a> shows an example of a network configured to use a mesh topology.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch4fig6"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 4-6</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Network configuration using a mesh topology</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01148.jpeg" width="278" height="315" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_97" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Note that most real-world implementations of a mesh network are actually a partial mesh where additional redundancy is added to the topology without incurring the expense of connecting everything to everything.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Tree</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a tree topology, multiple star networks are connected through a linear bus backbone. As you can see in <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4fig7">Figure 4-7</a>, if the backbone cable between the two star networks fails, those two networks would no longer be able to communicate; however, the computers on the same star network would still maintain communication with each other. The tree topology is the most commonly used configuration in today&#8217;s enterprise environment.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch4fig7"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 4-7</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Network configuration using a tree topology</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01149.jpeg" width="575" height="402" alt="Images"/></p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev104">Bandwidth and Latency</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you understand the different network topologies that you can configure, you need to know what other factors affect network performance. When moving to the cloud, network performance is crucial to the success of your deployment because the data is stored off-site. Two of the necessities to determining network performance are bandwidth and network latency. Bandwidth is the speed of the network. Network latency is the time delay that is encountered while data is being sent from one point to another on the network.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two types of latency: low latency and high latency. A low-latency network connection is a connection that experiences very small delays while sending and receiving traffic. A high-latency network has long delays while sending and receiving traffic. Network latency, when it is excessive, can create bottlenecks that prevent data from using the maximum capacity of the network bandwidth, thereby decreasing the effective bandwidth.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span id="page_98" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Compression</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compression is defined as the reduction in the size of data that is traveling across the network, which is achieved by converting that data into a format that requires fewer bits for the same transmission. Compression is typically used to minimize required storage space or to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network. When using compression to reduce the size of data that is being transferred, a network engineer sees a decrease in transmission times since there is more bandwidth available for other data to use as it traverses the network. Compression can result in higher processor utilization because a packet must be compressed and decompressed as it traverses the network.</p>
<p class="indent">Network compression can automatically compress data before it is sent over the network to help improve performance, especially where bandwidth is limited. Maximizing the compression ratio is vital to improving application performance on networks with limited bandwidth. Compression can play a key role in cloud computing. As an organization migrates to the cloud network, compression is vital in controlling network latency and maximizing network bandwidth.</p>

<h4 class="h4">Caching</h4>
<p class="noindent">Caching is the process of storing frequently accessed data in a location closer to the device that is requesting the data. For example, a web cache could store web pages and web content either on the physical machine that is accessing the website or on a storage device like a proxy server. This would increase the response time of the web page and reduce the amount of network traffic required to access the website, thus improving network speed and reducing network latency.</p>

</div>
<div class="side1">
<p class="indent"><strong>The most common type of caching occurs with proxy servers.</strong></p>
</div>
<hr class="hr-si1" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/>
<p class="indent">There are multiple benefits to caching, including the cost savings that comes with the reduction of bandwidth needed to access information via the Internet and the improved productivity of the end users (because cached information loads significantly faster than non-cached information). With your data now being stored in the cloud, it is important to understand how caching works and how to maximize caching to improve performance and maximize your network bandwidth.<span id="page_99" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev105">Load Balancing</h4>
<p class="noindent">Throughout this section, we have discussed the importance of optimizing network traffic and infrastructure. In order to optimize network traffic, the data must be routed as efficiently as possible. For example, if an organization&#8217;s network has five routers and three of them are running at 5 percent, and the other two are running at 90 percent, the network utilization is not as efficient as it possibly could be. If each of the routers were running at 20 percent utilization, it would improve network performance and limit network latency. The same could be said for a website that is getting thousands of hits every minute; it would be more efficient if the traffic were split between multiple web servers that are part of a web farm. This would increase performance and remove the single point of failure connected with having only one server respond to the requests.</p>
<p class="indent">Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming HTTP or application requests evenly across multiple devices or web servers so that no single device is overwhelmed. Load balancing allows for achieving optimal resource utilization and maximizing throughput without overloading a single device. Load balancing increases reliability by creating redundancy for your application or website by using dedicated hardware or software. <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4fig8">Figure 4-8</a> shows an example of how load balancing works for web servers.<span id="page_100" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch4lev106">Routing and Switching</h3>
<p class="noindent">We have discussed the different options and configurations that are available for setting up a network. Now let&#8217;s explore how to route traffic to and from networks. Knowing how a network operates is the most important piece to understanding routing and switching. In the previous section, you learned that a network operates by connecting computers and devices in a variety of different physical configurations. Routers and switches are the networking devices that enable other devices on the network to connect and communicate with each other and with other networks. They are placed on the same physical network as the other devices.</p>
<p class="indent">While routers and switches may give the impression they are rather similar, the devices are responsible for very different operations on a network. A switch is used to connect multiple devices to the same network or LAN. For example, a switch connects computers, printers, servers, and a variety of other devices and allows those devices to share network resources with each other. This makes it possible for users to share resources, saving valuable time and money for the organization. A router, on the other hand, is used to connect multiple networks together and allows a network to communicate with the outside world. An organization would use a router to connect its network to the Internet, thus allowing its users to share a single Internet connection. A router can analyze the data that is being sent over the network and change how it is packaged so that it can be routed to another network or even over a different type of network.</p>
<p class="indent">A router makes routing decisions based on the routing protocol configured on it. Each routing protocol uses a specific method to determine the best path a packet can take to its destination. Some routing protocols include Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP), open shortest path first (OSPF), and Routing Information Protocol (RIP). BGP uses rule sets, IGRP uses delay, load, and bandwidth, OSPF uses link state, and RIP uses hop count to make routing decisions.</p>

<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev107">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you know a router can allow users to share a single IP address when browsing the Internet, you need to understand how that process works. Network address translation, or NAT, allows a router to modify packets so that multiple devices can share a single public IP address. Most organizations require Internet access for their employees but do not have enough valid public IP addresses to allow each individual to have his or her own public address to locate resources outside of the organization&#8217;s network. The primary purpose of NAT is to limit the number of public IP addresses an organization needs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_101" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>NAT allows outbound Internet access, including for cloud-based virtual machines, but prevents inbound connections initiated from the Internet directly to inside machines or cloud-based virtual machines, which route through the NAT devices as their default gateway.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, most organizations use a private IP address range, which allows the devices on the network to communicate with all the other devices on the network and in turn makes it possible for users to share files, printers, and the like. But if those users need to access anything outside the network, they would require a public IP address. If Internet queries originate from various internal devices, the organization would need to have a valid public IP address for each device. NAT consolidates the addresses needed for each internal device to a single valid public IP address, allowing all of the organization&#8217;s employees to access the Internet with the use of a single public IP address.</p>
<p class="indent">To fully understand this concept, you first need to know what makes an IP address private and what makes an IP address public. Any IP address that falls into one of the IP address ranges that are reserved for private use by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is considered to be a private IP address. <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4tab1">Table 4-1</a> lists the different private IP address ranges.</p>

<p class="indent">A private network that adheres to the IETF published standard RFC 1918 is a network address space that is not used or allowed on the public Internet. These addresses are commonly used in a home or corporate network or LAN when a public IP address or globally routed address is not required on each device. Because these address ranges are not made available as public IP addresses, and consequently are never assigned specifically for use to any organization, they receive the designation of &#8220;private&#8221; IP addresses. IP packets that are addressed by private IP addresses cannot be transmitted onto the public Internet over the backbone.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two reasons for the recent surge in using RFC 1918 addresses: one is that Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address space is rapidly diminishing, and the other is that a significant security enhancement is achieved by providing address translation, whether it is NAT or PAT (described shortly) or a combination of the two. A perpetrator on the Internet cannot directly access a private IP address without the administrator taking significant steps to relax the security. A NAT router is sometimes referred to as a poor man&#8217;s firewall. In reality, it is not a firewall at all, but it shields the internal network (individuals using private addresses) from attacks and from what is sometimes referred to as Internet background radiation (IBR).</p>
<p class="indent">In order to access resources that are external to its network, an organization is required to have at least one &#8220;routable&#8221; or public IP address. This is where NAT comes into play. NAT allows a router to change the private IP address into a public IP address so that the organization can access resources that are external to it; then the NAT router tracks those IP address changes. When the external information being requested comes back to <span id="page_102" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>the router, the router changes the IP address from a public IP address to a private IP address so that it can forward the traffic back to the requesting device. Essentially, NAT allows a single device like a router to act as an agent or a go-between for a private network and the Internet. NAT provides the benefits of saving public IP addresses, higher security, and ease of administration.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to public and private IP addresses, there is also automatic private IP addressing (APIPA; sometimes called Autoconfig), which enables a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client to receive an IP address even if it cannot communicate with a DHCP server. APIPA addresses are &#8220;nonroutable&#8221; over the Internet and allocate an IP address in the private range of 169.254.0.1&#8211;169.254.255.254. APIPA uses Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to verify that the IP address is unique in the network.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong>You need to be able to quickly identify a private IP address, so it is advantageous to memorize the first octet of the IP ranges (i.e., 10, 172, and 192).</strong></p>

<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev108">Port Address Translation (PAT)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Similar to NAT, port address translation (PAT) allows for mapping of private IP addresses to public IP addresses as well as for mapping multiple devices on a network to a single public IP address. Its goal is the same as that of NAT: to conserve public IP addresses. PAT enables the sharing of a single public IP address between multiple clients trying to access the Internet.</p>
<p class="indent">A good example of PAT is a home network where multiple devices are trying to access the Internet at the same time. In this instance, your ISP would assign your home network&#8217;s router a single public IP address. On this network, you could have multiple computers or devices trying to access the Internet at the same time using the same router. When device Y logs on to the Internet, it is assigned a port number that is appended to the private IP address. This gives device Y a unique IP address. If device Z were to log on to the Internet at the same time, the router would assign the same public IP address to device Z but with a different port number. The two devices are sharing the same public IP address to browse the Internet, but the router distributes the requested content to the appropriate device based on the port number the router has assigned to that particular device.</p>

<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev109">Subnetting and Supernetting</h4>
<p class="noindent">Subnetting is the practice of creating subnetworks, or subnets. A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. Using subnets may be useful in large organizations where it is necessary to allocate address space efficiently. They may also be utilized to increase routing <span id="page_103" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>efficiency, and offer improved controls for network management when different networks require separation of administrator control for different entities in a large or multitenant environment. Inter-subnet traffic is exchanged by routers, just as it would be exchanged between physical networks.</p>
<p class="indent">All computers that belong to a particular subnet are addressed with the use of two separate bit groups in their IP address, with one group designating the subnet and the other group designating the particular host on that subnet. The routing prefix of the address can be expressed in either classful notation or classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation. CIDR has become the most popular routing notation method in recent years. This notation is written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash (/), then finishing with the bit length of the prefix. To use a typical example, 192.168.1.0/24 is the prefix of the network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. An allocation of 24 bits is equal to the subnet mask for that network, which you may recognize as the familiar 255.255.255.0.</p>
<p class="indent">As subnetting is the practice of dividing one network into multiple networks, supernetting does the exact opposite, combining multiple networks into one larger network. Supernetting is most often utilized to combine multiple class C networks. It was created to solve the problem of routing tables growing too large for administrators to manage by aggregating networks under one routing table entry. It also provided a solution to the problem of class B network address space running out.</p>
<p class="indent">In much the same fashion as subnetting, supernetting takes the IP address and breaks it down into a network bit group and a host identifier bit group. It also uses CIDR notation. The way to identify supernetted networks is that the network prefix is always lower than 23, which allows for a greater number of hosts (on the larger network) to be specified in the host bit group.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev110">Network Segmentation and Micro-Segmentation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Network segmentation and micro-segmentation are techniques to divide the network into smaller pieces to isolate or better control traffic and to apply more granular policies to those network segments. Both segmentation and micro-segmentation can be used to reduce the spread of malicious code or make attacks harder, as attackers will need to figure out how to move between network segments before they can attack nodes in another segment.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev111">Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)</h4>
<p class="noindent">A virtual local area network, or VLAN, is the concept of partitioning a physical network to create separate, independent broadcast domains that are part of the same physical network. VLANs are very similar to physical LANs but add the ability to break up physical networks into logical groupings of networks all within the same physical network.</p>
<p class="indent">VLANs were conceived out of the desire to create logical separation without the need for additional physical hardware (i.e., network cards, wiring, and routers). VLANs can even traverse physical networks, forming a logical network or VLAN even if the devices exist on <span id="page_104" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>separate physical networks. With the use of a virtual private network (VPN), which extends a private network over a public network such as the Internet, a VLAN can even traverse the entire Internet. For example, you could implement a VLAN to place only certain end users inside the VLAN to help control broadcast traffic.</p>
<p class="indent">VLAN tagging is the process of inserting a 4-byte header directly after the destination address and the source address of the Ethernet frame header. There are two types of VLAN tagging mechanisms: Inter-Switch Link (ISL), which is proprietary to Cisco equipment, and IEEE 802.1Q, which is supported by everyone including Cisco and is usually the VLAN option of choice. Utilizing the IEEE 802.1Q protocol, approximately 4,095 different VLAN IDs can be achieved on the same physical network segment (depending on what is supported by the switch and router devices).</p>
<p class="indent">A VLAN is usually associated with an IP subnet, so all the devices in that IP subnet belong to the same VLAN. In order to configure a VLAN, you must first create a VLAN and then bind the interface and IP address to it. VLANs must be routed, and there are various methods for assigning VLAN membership to switch ports. Switch ports can be assigned membership to a particular VLAN on a port-by-port basis manually; they can be dynamically configured from a VLAN membership policy server that tracks MAC addresses and their associated VLANs for port configuration; or they can be classified based on their IP address if the packets are untagged or priority tagged.</p>
<p class="text-icon"><img src="../Images/image01119.jpeg" width="58" height="40" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="text-icon1"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>One of the organizations we worked for was a small college that had multiple training rooms and wanted to control broadcast traffic. This was a perfect situation for a VLAN. We set up a separate VLAN for each of the classrooms so that none of the classrooms would cause unnecessary broadcast traffic to the others.</p>
<p class="indent">Broadcasts by their very nature are processed and received by each member of the broadcast domain. VLANs can improve network performance by segmenting the network into groups that share broadcast traffic. For example, each floor of a building might have its own subnet. It might make sense to create a VLAN for that subnet to control broadcasts to other floors of the building, thus reducing the need to send broadcasts to unnecessary destinations (in this case, another floor of the building). The general rule for VLANs is to keep the resources that are needed for the VLAN and that are consumed by members of the VLAN on that same VLAN. Latency issues will occur whenever a packet must cross a VLAN, as it must be routed. This situation should be avoided if possible.</p>
<p class="indent">The type of port that supports a VLAN is called an access link. When a device connects using an access link, it is unaware of any VLAN membership. It behaves as if it were a component of a broadcast domain. All VLAN information is removed by switches from the frame before it gets to the device connected to the access link. No communication or interaction can take place between the access link devices and the devices outside of their designated VLAN. This communication is only made possible when the packet is routed through a router.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_105" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>A trunk link, also known just as a &#8220;trunk,&#8221; is a port that transports packets for any VLAN. These trunk ports are usually found in connections between switches, and require the ability to carry packets from all available VLANs because those VLANs span multiple switches. Trunk ports are typically VLAN 0 or VLAN 1, but there is nothing magical about those numbers. It is up to the manufacturer to determine which ID is designated as the trunk port. Specifications are spelled out in the 802.1Q protocol, but just like any other &#8220;blueprint,&#8221; some manufacturers will make their own interpretation of how trunk ports should be implemented.</p>
<p class="indent">For cloud VLANs, it is important to understand another type of VLAN known as a private VLAN, or PVLAN. PVLANs contain switch ports that cannot communicate with each other but can access another network. PVLANs restrict traffic through the use of private ports so that they communicate only with a specific uplink trunk port. A good example of the utilization of a PVLAN is in a hotel setting. Each room of the hotel has a port that can access the Internet, but it is not advantageous for the rooms to communicate with each other.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev112">Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN)</h4>
<p class="noindent">The virtual extensible LAN (VXLAN) is a method of encapsulating, or tunneling, frames across UDP port 4789. The data addressed to another member of a VXLAN is placed inside the UDP packet and routed to its destination, at which point it is de-encapsulated so that the receiving port, known as a VXLAN tunnel endpoint (VTEP), can receive it as if it were sent over a local network.</p>
<p class="indent">VXLANs are primarily used in cloud environments to segment different tenants. VXLANs were created because VLANs use a 12-bit VLAN ID that can have a maximum of 4,096 network IDs assigned at one time. This is not enough addresses for many large cloud environments. VXLANs use a 24-bit segment ID that allows for 16 million segments, which provides enough segments for many more customers. Similar to VLANs, switch ports can be members of a VXLAN. VXLAN members can be either virtual or physical switch ports.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev113">Routing Tables</h4>
<p class="noindent">A routing table is a set of procedures, stored on a router, that the router uses to determine the destination of network packets it is responsible for routing. The routing table contains information about the network topology that is located adjacent to the router as well as information gathered from neighboring routers. This information is used by routers to determine which path to send packets down in order to efficiently deliver information to its destination.</p>
<p class="indent">Routers may know of multiple paths to a destination and the routing table will rank these paths in order of efficiency. The method of ordering the paths depends on the routing protocol used. If the most efficient path is unavailable, the router will select the next best path as defined by its routing table.<span id="page_106" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch4lev114">Network Ports and Protocols</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you understand how to select the physical network configuration and segment and route network traffic, you need to learn about the different ports and protocols that are used in cloud computing. A network port is an application-specific endpoint to a logical connection. It is how a client program finds a specific service on a device. A network protocol, on the other hand, is an understood set of rules agreed upon by two or more parties that determines how network devices exchange information over a network. In this section, we discuss the different protocols used to securely connect a network to the Internet so that it can communicate with the cloud environment.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev115">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol built on TCP used to distribute Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files, text, images, sound, videos, multimedia, and other types of information over the Internet. HTTP typically allows for communication between a web client or web browser and a web server hosting a website. HTTP defines how messages between a web browser and a web server are formatted and transmitted and which actions the web server and browser should take when they are issued specific commands. HTTP uses port 80 to communicate by default.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of HTTP that provides secure communication over the Internet. HTTPS is not a separate protocol from HTTP; it layers the security capabilities of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) on top of HTTP to provide security to standard HTTP, since HTTP communicates in plain text. HTTPS uses port 443 by default.</p>
<p class="indent">When a web client first accesses a website using HTTPS, the server sends a certificate with its embedded public key to the web client. The client generates a session key (sometimes called a symmetric key) and encrypts the session key with the server&#8217;s public key. The server has the private key, which is the other half of the public&#8211;private key pair and can decrypt the session key, which allows for a covert and confidential exchange of a very fast session key. No entity other than the server has access to the private key.</p>
<p class="indent">During the standard process of authentication, the client then verifies that the certificate is in its trusted root store, thus trusting the certificate was signed by a trusted certificate authority. After the client can verify the certificate is coming from the correct web server, it creates a session key that is only accessible by that web client. It encrypts the session <span id="page_107" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>key using the public key it received from the web server in the form of a certificate with an embedded public key. The sending server is the only entity that should have a copy of the private key so that it can decrypt the sent session key. Now both entities have a copy of the very fast session key, and the server receives it securely. Once both the web client and the web server know the session key, the SSL/TLS handshake is complete, and the session is encrypted. As part of the protocol, either the client or the server can ask that the key be &#8220;rolled&#8221; at any time. Rolling the key is simply asking the browser to generate a new 40-, 128-, or 256-bit key or above, forcing a would-be attacker to shoot at a moving target.</p>

<p class="text-icon1"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>A good example of using HTTPS comes from an experience working for a large retail firm. The employer needed an e-commerce web page that could receive credit card payments over the Internet, which in turn required a secure form of transmission for data as it traveled over the Internet. So the organization had to purchase a certificate from a trusted certificate authority (e.g., Verisign) and deploy it on its internal web servers. Once the certificate was purchased and deployed to the servers, customers were able to use HTTPS to communicate with the web page and thus purchase products using their credit card information in a secure manner.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev116">File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and FTP over SSL (FTPS)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Unlike HTTP, which is used to view web pages over the Internet, the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used to download and transfer files over the Internet. FTP is a standard network protocol that allows for access to and transfer of files over the Internet using either the FTP client or command-line interface. An organization hosts files on an FTP server so that people from outside the organization can download those files to their local computers. <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4fig9">Figure 4-9</a> shows an example of a graphical-based FTP client.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch4fig9"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 4-9</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Screenshot of a graphical-based FTP client</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01152.jpeg" width="750" height="623" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="indent">FTP is built on a client-server architecture and provides a data connection between the FTP client and the FTP server. The FTP server is the computer that stores the files and authenticates the FTP client. The FTP server listens on the network for incoming FTP connection requests from FTP clients. The clients, on the other hand, use either the command-line interface or FTP client software to connect to the FTP server.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_108" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>After the FTP server has authenticated the client, the client can download files, rename files, upload files, and delete files on the FTP server based on the client&#8217;s permissions. The FTP client software has an interface that allows you to explore the directory of the FTP server, just like you would use Windows Explorer to explore the content of your local hard drive on a Microsoft Windows&#8211;based computer.</p>
<p class="indent">Similar to how HTTPS is an extension of HTTP, FTPS is an extension of FTP that allows clients to request that their FTP session be encrypted. FTPS allows for the encrypted and secure transfer of files over FTP using SSL or TLS. There are two different methods for securing client access to the FTP server: implicit and explicit. Implicit mode gives an FTPS-aware client the ability to require a secure connection with an FTPS-aware server without affecting the FTP functionality of non-FTPS-aware clients. With explicit mode, a client must explicitly request a secure connection from the FTPS server; then the security and encryption method must be agreed upon between the FTPS server and the FTPS client. If the client does not request a secure connection, the FTPS server can either allow or refuse the client&#8217;s connection to the FTPS server.<span id="page_109" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev117">Secure Shell File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Secure Shell File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a network protocol designed to provide secure access to files, file transfers, file editing, and file management over the Internet using a Secure Shell (SSH) session. Unlike FTP, SFTP encrypts both the data and the FTP commands, preventing the information from being transmitted in clear text over the Internet. SFTP differs from FTPS in that SFTP uses SSH to secure the file transfer and FTPS uses SSL or TLS to secure the file transfer.</p>
<p class="indent">SFTP clients are functionally similar to FTP clients, except SFTP clients use SSH to access and transfer files over the Internet. An organization cannot use standard FTP client software to access an SFTP server, nor can it use SFTP client software to access FTP servers.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a few things to consider when deciding on which method should be used to secure FTP servers. SFTP is generally more secure and superior to FTPS. If the organization is going to connect to a Linux or Unix FTP server, SFTP is the better choice because it is supported by default on these operating systems. If one of the requirements for the FTP server is that it needs to be accessible from personal devices, such as tablets and smartphones, then FTPS would be the better option since most of these devices natively support FTPS but may not support SFTP.</p>

<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev118">Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Domain Name System (DNS) distributes the responsibility for both the assignment of domain names and the mapping of those names to IP addresses to the authoritative name servers within each domain. An authoritative name server is responsible for maintaining its specific domain name and can also be authoritative for subdomains of that primary domain. For example, if you want to go to a particular web page like <a href="https://www.comptia.org">https://www.comptia.org</a>, all you do is type the name of the web page into your browser, and it displays the web page. For your web browser to display that web page by name, it needs to be able to locate it by IP address. This is where DNS comes into play.</p>
<p class="indent">DNS translates Internet domain or host names into IP addresses. DNS would automatically convert the name <a href="https://www.comptia.org">https://www.comptia.org</a> into an IP address for the web server hosting that web page. In order to store the entire name and address information for all the public hosts on the Internet, DNS uses a distributed hierarchical database. DNS databases reside in <span id="page_110" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>a hierarchy of database servers where no one DNS server contains all the information. <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4fig10">Figure 4-10</a> shows an example of how a client performs a DNS search.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch4fig10"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 4-10</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;The steps in a DNS search</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01153.jpeg" width="751" height="447" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="indent">DNS consists of a tree of domain names. Each branch of the tree has a domain name and contains resource records for that domain. Resource records describe specific information about a particular object. The DNS zone at the top of the tree is called the root zone. Each zone under the root zone has a unique domain name or multiple domain names, and the owner of that domain name is considered authoritative for that DNS zone. <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4fig11">Figure 4-11</a> shows the DNS hierarchy and how a URL is resolved to an IP address.</p>
<p class="figcap" id="ch4fig11"><span class="figure"><strong>FIGURE 4-11</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;Example of a DNS hierarchy</p>
<p class="imagef"><img src="../Images/image01154.jpeg" width="716" height="556" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="indent">DNS servers manage DNS zones. Servers store records for resources within one or more domains that they are configured and authorized to manage. A host record or &#8220;A&#8221; record is used to store information on a domain or subdomain along with its IP address. A canonical name (CNAME) record is an alias for a host record. For example, a CNAME record testing for the <a href="http://comptia.org">comptia.org</a> domain pointing to www would allow for users to enter the URL <a href="http://www.comptia.org">www.comptia.org</a> or <a href="http://testing.comptia.orgto">testing.comptia.orgto</a> go to the same site. A mail exchanger (MX) record stores information on the mail server for the domain, if one exists.</p>
<p class="indent">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol that allows a server to automatically assign IP addresses from a predefined range of numbers, called a scope, to computers on a network. DHCP is responsible for assigning IP addresses to computers, and DNS is responsible for resolving those IP addresses to names. A DHCP server can register and update resource records on a DNS server on behalf of a DHCP client. A DHCP server is <span id="page_111" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>used any time an organization does not wish to use static IP addresses (IP addresses that are manually assigned).</p>
<p class="indent">DHCP servers maintain a database of available IP addresses and configuration options. The DHCP server leases an IP address to a client based on the network to which that client is connected. The DHCP client is then responsible for renewing its lease or IP addresses before the lease expires. DHCP supports both IPv4 and IPv6. It can also be used to create a static IP address mapping by creating a reservation that assigns a particular IP address to a computer based on that computer&#8217;s media access control (MAC) address.</p>
<p class="indent">If an organization&#8217;s network has only one IP subnet, clients can communicate directly with the DHCP server. If the network has multiple subnets, the company can still use a DHCP server to allocate IP addresses to the network clients. To allow a DHCP client on a subnet that is not directly connected to the DHCP server to communicate with the DHCP server, the organization can configure a DHCP relay agent in the DHCP client&#8217;s subnet. <span id="page_112" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>A DHCP relay agent is an agent that relays DHCP communication between DHCP clients and DHCP servers on different IP subnets. DNS and DHCP work together to help clients on an organization&#8217;s network communicate as efficiently as possible, and allow the clients to discover and share resources located on the network.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev119">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Documents and videos are not the only pieces of information that you might want to share and communicate over the Internet. While HTTP and FTP allow you to share files, videos, and pictures over the Internet, SMTP is the protocol that allows you to send e-mail over the Internet. SMTP uses port 25 and provides a standard set of codes that help to simplify the delivery of e-mail messages between e-mail servers. Almost all e-mail servers that send e-mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another. After the e-mail server has received the message, the user can view that e-mail using an e-mail client, such as Microsoft Outlook. The e-mail client also uses SMTP to send messages from the client to the e-mail server.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch4lev120">Well-Known Ports</h4>
<p class="noindent">Ports are used in a TCP or UDP network to specify the endpoint of a logical connection and how the client can access a specific application on a server over the network. Port binding is used to determine where and how a message is transmitted. Link aggregation can also be implemented to combine multiple network connections to increase throughput. The well-known ports are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and range from 0 to 1023. The IANA is responsible for maintaining the official assignments of port numbers for a specific purpose. You do not need to know all of the well-known ports for the CompTIA Cloud+ exam, so we are going to focus only on the ports that are relevant to the exam. <a href="part0018.xhtml#ch4tab2">Table 4-2</a> specifies the server process and its communication port.</p>

<hr class="hrg"/>
<p class="noindent">A network&#8217;s physical topology is a key factor in its overall performance. This chapter explained the various physical topologies and when to use each of them. It also discussed how traffic is routed across the network, which is key to understanding <span id="page_113" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>how to implement cloud computing. Since most information is accessed over an Internet connection, it is very important to know how to properly configure a network and how it is routed.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a variety of different ways to reduce network latency and improve network response time and performance, including caching, compression, load balancing, and maintaining the physical hardware. These issues are critical for ensuring that an organization meets the terms of its SLA.<span id="page_114" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>

Compression is defined as the reduction in the size of data, which is done by converting that data into a format that requires fewer bits and does not define the amount of data that can be sent over the network. Again, this is a technology that helps with the receiving end of the network traffic but will not alleviate performance issues on the hosting server.
