Disk system performance is a key factor to the overall health of the cloud environment, and you need to understand the different types of disks that are available and the benefits of each. Once an organization chooses the type of disk to use in its cloud environment, it needs to protect the data that is stored on the disk. Along with describing the different types of disks and how to connect those disks to the system, this chapter illustrates how data can be tiered to provide better utilization of disk resources and better application performance.

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch2lev41">Disk Types and Configurations</h3>
<p class="noindent">Disk drive technology has advanced at an astonishing rate over the past few years, making terabytes of storage available at a relatively low cost to consumers. Evaluating what types of disks to buy requires careful planning and evaluation of the purpose of the disk. If an organization is looking for a type of drive to support its database environment, it would be interested in a drive with high disk I/O as opposed to a drive that supports a file share on a test network (in which case the need is for disk space over disk I/O). In the following sections, we examine each of the different disk types and clarify these distinctions.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev42">Rotational Media</h4>
<p class="noindent">Disk storage is a generic term used to describe storage mechanisms where data is digitally recorded by various electronic, magnetic, optical, or mechanical methods on a rotating disk, or media. A disk drive is a device that uses this storage mechanism with fixed or removable media. Removable media refers to an optical disc, memory card, flash media, or USB drive, and fixed or nonremovable media refers to a hard disk drive.</p>
<p class="indent">A hard disk drive (HDD) uses rapidly rotating disks called platters coated with a magnetic material known as ferrous oxide to store and retrieve digital information. An HDD retains the data on the drive even when the drive is powered off. The data on an HDD is read in a random-access manner. What this means is that an individual block of data can be stored or retrieved in any order rather than only being accessible sequentially, as in the case of data that might exist on a tape.</p>
<p class="indent">An HDD contains one or more platters with read/write heads arranged on a moving arm that floats above the ferrous oxide surface to read and write data to the drive. HDDs have been the primary storage device for computers since the 1960s. Today the most common sizes for HDDs are the 3.5 inch, which is used primarily in desktop computers, and the 2.5 inch, which is used primarily in laptop computers. The primary competitors of the HDD are the solid state drive (SSD) and flash memory cards. HDDs should remain the dominating medium for secondary storage, but SSDs are replacing rotating hard drives in portable electronic devices because of their speed and ruggedness.<span id="page_33" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>

<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev43">Solid State Drive (SSD)</h4>
<p class="noindent">A solid state drive (SSD) is a high-performance storage device that contains no moving parts. It includes either dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) or flash memory boards, a memory bus board, a central processing unit (CPU), and sometimes a battery or separate power source. The majority of SSDs use &#8220;not and&#8221; (NAND)&#8211;based flash memory, which is a nonvolatile memory type, meaning the drive can retain data without power. SSDs produce the highest possible I/O rates because they contain their own CPUs to manage data storage. SSDs are less susceptible to shock or being dropped, are much quieter, and have a faster access time and lower latency than HDDs. SSDs and traditional hard disks have the same I/O interface, allowing SSDs to easily replace a traditional hard disk drive without changing the computer hardware.</p>
<p class="indent">While SSDs can be used in all types of scenarios, they are especially valuable in a system where I/O response time is critical, such as a database server, a server hosting a file share, or any application that has a disk I/O bottleneck. Another example of where an SSD is a good candidate is in a laptop. SSDs are shock resistant; they also use less power and provide a faster startup time than HDDs. Since an SSD has no moving parts, both sleep response time and system response time are improved. SSDs are currently more expensive than traditional hard disk drives but are less of a risk for failure and data loss. <a href="part0016.xhtml#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a> shows you some of the differences between SSDs and traditional hard disk drives.</p>

<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev44">USB Drive</h4>
<p class="noindent">A universal serial bus (USB) drive is an external plug-and-play storage device that can be plugged into a computer&#8217;s USB port and is recognized by the computer as a removable drive and assigned a drive letter by the computer. Unlike an HDD or SSD, a USB drive does not require a special connection cable and power cable to connect to the system, because it is powered via the USB port of the computer. Since a USB drive is portable and retains the data stored on it as it is moved between computer systems, it is a great device for transferring files quickly between computers or servers. There are many external storage devices that use USB, such as hard drives, flash drives, and DVD drives.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev45">Tape</h4>
<p class="noindent">A tape drive is a storage device that reads and writes data to a magnetic tape. Using tape as a form of storage has been around for a long time. The role of tape has changed tremendously over the years and is still changing. Tape is now finding a niche in the market for longer-term storage and archiving of data, and it is the medium of choice for storage at an off-site location.</p>

<p class="indent"><span id="page_34" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><span id="page_35" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Tape drives provide sequential access to the data, whereas an HDD provides random access to the data. A tape drive has to physically wind the tape between reels to read any one particular piece of data. As a result, it has a slow seek time, having to wait for the tape to be in the correct position to access the data. Tape drives have a wide range of capacity and allow for data to be compressed to a size smaller than that of the files stored on the disk.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev46">Interface Types</h4>
<p class="noindent">HDDs interface with a computer in a variety of ways, including ATA, SATA, Fibre Channel, SCSI, SAS, and IDE. Here we look at each of these interface technologies in greater detail. HDDs connect to a host bus interface adapter with a single data cable. Each HDD has its own power cable that is connected to the computer&#8217;s power supply.</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA)</em> is an interface standard for connecting storage devices within computers. ATA is often referred to as Parallel ATA (or PATA).</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE)</em> is the integration of the controller and the hard drive itself, which allows the drive to connect directly to the motherboard or controller. IDE is also known as ATA.</p>

Designed to replace PATA, it offers several advantages over its predecessor, including reduced cable size, lower cost, native hot swapping, faster throughput, and more efficient data transfer.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)</em> is a set of standard electronic interfaces accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for connecting and transferring data between computers and storage devices. SCSI is faster and more flexible than earlier transfer interfaces. It uses a bus interface type, and every device in the chain requires a unique ID.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)</em> is a data transfer technology that was designed to replace SCSI and to transfer data to and from storage devices. SAS is backward compatible with SATA drives.</p>

Fibre Channel is well suited to connect servers to a shared storage device such as a storage area network (SAN) due to its high-speed transfer rate of up to 16 gigabits per second. Fibre Channel is often referred to as FC in the industry and on the Cloud+ exam.</p>

<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev47">Access Speed</h4>
<p class="noindent">Just knowing the types of hard disks and the interface is not enough to calculate which drive type is best for a particular application. Understanding the speed at which a drive can access the data that is stored on that drive is critical to the performance of the application. A hard drive&#8217;s speed is measured by the amount of time it takes to access the data that is stored on the drive. Access time is the response time of the drive and is a direct correlation of seek time and latency. The actuator arm and read-write head of the drive must move for data to be located. First, the actuator arm must move the head to the correct location on the platter. <span id="page_37" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>The time it takes for the arm to move to the correct location is known as seek time. At the same time, the platter must rotate to the desired sector. The time it takes for the platter to spin to the desired location is known as rotational latency, or just latency for short.</p>
<p class="indent">The access time of an HDD can be improved by either increasing the rotational speed of the drive or reducing the time the drive has to spend seeking the data. Seek time generally falls in the range of 3 to 15 milliseconds (ms). The faster the disk can spin, the faster it can find the data and the lower the latency for that drive will be. <a href="part0016.xhtml#ch2tab3">Table 2-3</a> lists the average latency based on some common hard disk speeds.</p>

<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev48">Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far in this chapter you have learned about the different disk types and how those disk types connect to a computer system. The next thing you need to understand is how to make the data that is stored on those disk drives as redundant as possible while maintaining a high-performance system. RAID is a storage technology that combines multiple hard disk drives into a single logical unit so that the data can be distributed across the hard disk drives for both improved performance and increased security according to their various RAID levels.</p>
<p class="indent">There are four primary RAID levels in use and several additional RAID levels, called nested RAID levels, that are built on top of the four primary types. RAID 0 takes two disks and stripes the data across them. It has the highest speed, but a failure of any disk results in data loss for the entire RAID set. RAID 1, also known as a mirror, stores identical copies of data on two drives for reliability. However, speeds are limited to the capabilities of a single drive and twice as much storage is required for data. RAID 5 stripes data across disks in the set and uses parity to reconstruct a drive if it fails in the set. RAID 5 requires at least three drives. It has good read performance, but the computation of parity can reduce write speeds in what is known as the write penalty. RAID 6 is like RAID 5 except it stores double parity and can recover from a loss of two drives. It has a higher write penalty.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_38" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Nested RAID consists of RAID 10 (RAID 1+0), which takes a number of mirror sets and stripes data over them. It has high read and write performance but requires double the drives for storage. RAID 50 is another type of nested RAID where two RAID5 sets are striped together. It can offer higher performance than the RAID 5 arrays could individually while still retaining the parity on the underlying RAID 5.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="part0016.xhtml#ch2tab4">Table 2-4</a> compares the different RAID configurations to give you a better understanding of the advantages and requirements of each RAID level.</p>
<p class="tabcap" id="ch2tab4"><span class="table"><strong>TABLE 2-4</strong></span>&#160;&#160;&#160;RAID Level Benefits and Requirements</p>
<p class="imaget"><img src="../Images/image01133.jpeg" width="902" height="437" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="indent">There are two different options available when implementing RAID: software RAID and hardware RAID using a RAID controller. Software RAID is implemented on a server by using software that groups multiple logical disks into a single virtual disk. Most modern operating systems have built-in software that allows for the configuration of a software-based RAID array. Hardware RAID controllers are physical cards that are added to a server to off-load the overhead of RAID and do not require any CPU resources; they allow an administrator to boot straight to the RAID controller to configure the RAID levels. Hardware RAID is the most common form of RAID due to its tighter integration with the device and better error handling.<span id="page_39" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch2lev49">Tiering</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the previous section, we discussed the different types of disks and the benefits of each of those disk types. Now that you understand the benefits of each disk, you know that storing data on the appropriate disk type can increase performance and decrease the cost of storing that data. Having flexibility in how and where to store an application&#8217;s data is key to the success of cloud computing.</p>
<p class="indent">Tiered storage permits an organization to adjust where its data is being stored based on performance, availability, cost, and recovery requirements of an application. For example, data that is stored for restoration in the event of loss or corruption would be stored on the local drive so that it can be recovered quickly, whereas data that is stored for regulatory purposes would be archived to a lower-cost disk like tape storage.</p>
<p class="indent">Tiered storage can refer to an infrastructure that has a simple two-tier architecture, consisting of SCSI disks and a tape drive, or to a more complex scenario of three or four tiers. Tiered storage helps organizations plan their information life cycle management, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. Tiered storage requirements can also be determined by functional differences, for example, the need for replication and high-speed restoration.</p>
<p class="indent">With tiered storage, data can be moved from fast, expensive disks to slower, less expensive disks. Hierarchical storage management (HSM), which is discussed in the next section, allows for automatically moving data between four different tiers of storage. For example, data that is frequently used and stored on highly available, expensive disks can be automatically migrated to less expensive tape storage when it is no longer required on a day-to-day basis. One of the advantages of HSM is that the total amount of data that is stored can be higher than the capacity of the disk storage system currently in place.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev50">Performance Levels of Each Tier</h4>
<p class="noindent">Hierarchical storage management (HSM) operates transparently to users of a system. HSM organizes data into tiers based on the performance capabilities of the devices, with tier 1 containing the devices with the highest performance and each tier after that containing storage with lower performance than the tier before it. HSM tiers can include a wide variety of local and remote media such as solid state, spinning disk, tape, and cloud storage.</p>
<p class="indent">HSM places data on tiers based on the level of access required and the performance and reliability needed for that particular data or based on file size and available capacity. Organizations can save time and money by implementing a tiered storage infrastructure. Each tier has its own set of benefits and usage scenarios based on a variety of factors. HSM can automatically move data between tiers based on factors such as how often data is used, but organizations can also specify policies to further control where HSM stores data and what priority it gives to migration operations between tiers.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_40" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>The first step in customizing HSM policies is to understand the data that will reside on HSM storage. Organizations and IT departments need to define each type of data and determine how to classify it so that they can configure HSM policies appropriately. Ask yourself some of the following questions:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Is the data critical to the day-to-day operation of the organization?</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Is there an archiving requirement for the data after so many months or years?</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Is there a legal or regulatory requirement to store the data for a period of time?</p>
<p class="noindent">Once the data has been classified, the organization can create HSM policies so that data is moved to the appropriate tier and given the correct priority.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Tier 1</h4>
<p class="noindent">Tier 1 data is defined as mission-critical, recently accessed, or secure files and should be stored on expensive and highly available disks such as RAID with parity. Tier 1 storage systems have better performance, capacity, reliability, and manageability.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Tier 2</h4>
<p class="noindent">Tier 2 data is data that runs major business applications, for example, e-mail and ERP. Tier 2 is a balance between cost and performance. Tier 2 data does not require sub-second response time but still needs to be reasonably fast.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Tier 3</h4>
<p class="noindent">Tier 3 data includes financial data that needs to be kept for tax purposes but is not accessed on a daily basis and so does not need to be stored on the expensive tier 1 or tier 2 storage systems.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Tier 4</h4>
<p class="noindent">Tier 4 data is data that is used for compliance requirements for keeping e-mails or data for long periods of time. Tier 4 data can be a large amount of data but does not need to be instantly accessible.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev51">Policies</h4>
<p class="noindent">A multitiered storage system provides an automated way to move data between more expensive and less expensive storage systems, as an organization can implement policies that define what data fits into each tier and then manage how that data migrates between the tiers. For example, when financial data is more than a year old, the policy could be to move that data to a tier 4 storage solution, much like the HSM defined earlier.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Tiered storage provides IT departments with the best solution for managing the organization&#8217;s data while also saving time and money. Tiered storage helps IT departments meet their service level agreements at the lowest possible cost and the highest possible efficiency.</p>

<h3 class="h3-a" id="ch2lev52">File System Types</h3>
<p class="noindent">After choosing a disk type and configuration, an organization needs to be able to store data on those disks. The file system is responsible for storing, retrieving, and updating a set of files on a disk. It is the software that accepts the commands from the operating system to read and write data to the disk. It is responsible for how the files are named and stored on the disk.</p>
<p class="indent">The file system is also responsible for managing access to the file&#8217;s metadata (&#8220;the data about the data&#8221;) and the data itself and for overseeing the relationships to other files and file attributes. It also manages how much available space the disk has. The file system is responsible for the reliability of the data on the disk and for organizing that data in an efficient manner. It organizes the files and directories and tracks which areas of the drive belong to a particular file and which areas are not currently being utilized.</p>
<p class="indent">This section explains the different file system types. Each file system has its own set of benefits and scenarios under which its use is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev53">Unix File System</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Unix file system (UFS) is the primary file system for Unix and Unix-based operating systems. UFS uses a hierarchical file system structure where the highest level of the directory is called the root (/, pronounced &#8220;slash&#8221;) and all other directories span from that root. Under the root directory, files are organized into subdirectories and can have any name the user wishes to assign. All files on a Unix system are related to one another in a parent-child relationship, and they all share a common parental link to the top of the hierarchy.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="part0016.xhtml#ch2fig1">Figure 2-1</a> shows an example of the UFS structure. The root directory has three subdirectories called bin, tmp, and users. The users directory has two subdirectories of its own called Nate and Scott.</p>

<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev54">Extended File System</h4>
<p class="noindent">The extended file system (EXT) is the first file system created specifically for Linux. The metadata and file structure is based on the Unix file system. EXT is the default file system for most Linux distributions. EXT is currently on version 4, or EXT4, which was introduced in <span id="page_42" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>2008 and supports a larger file and file system size. EXT4 is backward compatible with EXT3 and EXT2, which allows for mounting an EXT3 and EXT2 partition as an EXT4 partition.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev55">File Allocation Table File System</h4>
<p class="noindent">The file allocation table (FAT) file system is a legacy file system that provides good performance but does not deliver the same reliability and scalability as some of the newer file systems. The FAT file system is still supported by most operating systems for backward compatibility reasons but has mostly been replaced by NTFS (more on this in a moment) as the preferred file system for the Microsoft operating system. If a user has a drive running a FAT32 file system partition, however, they can connect it to a computer running Windows 7 and retrieve the data from that drive because. All modern versions of Windows, including 7, 8, and 10, still support the FAT32 file system.</p>
<p class="indent">The FAT file system is used by a variety of removable media, including solid state memory cards, flash memory cards, and portable devices. The FAT file system does not support the advanced features of NTFS like encryption, VSS, and compression.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev56">New Technology File System</h4>
<p class="noindent">The new technology file system (NTFS) is a proprietary file system developed by Microsoft to support the Windows operating systems. It first became available with Windows NT 3.1 and has been used on all of Microsoft&#8217;s operating systems since then. NTFS was Microsoft&#8217;s replacement for the FAT file system. NTFS has many advantages over FAT, including improved performance and reliability, larger partition sizes, and enhanced security. NTFS uses the NT LAN Manager (NTLM) protocol for authentication.</p>
<p class="indent">Starting with version 1.2, NTFS added support for file compression, which is ideal for files that are written to on an infrequent basis. However, compression can lead to slower performance when accessing the compressed files; therefore, it is not recommended for .exe or .dll files, or for network shares that contain roaming profiles due to the extra processing required to load roaming profiles.</p>
<p class="indent">NTFS version 3.0 added support for volume shadow copy service (VSS), which keeps a historical version of files and folders on an NTFS volume. Shadow copies allow you to restore a file to a previous state without the need for backup software. The VSS creates a copy of the old file as it is writing the new file so the user has access to the previous version of that file. It is best practice to create a shadow copy volume on a separate disk to store the files.<span id="page_43" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>
<h4 class="h4">Encrypting File System</h4>
<p class="noindent">The encrypting file system (EFS) provides an encryption method for any file or folder on an NTFS partition and is transparent to the user. EFS encrypts a file by using a file encryption key (FEK), which is associated with a public key that is tied to the user who encrypted the file. The encrypted data is stored in an alternate location from the encrypted file. To decrypt the file, EFS uses the private key of the user to decrypt the public key that is stored in the file header. If the user loses access to their key, a recovery agent can still access the files. NTFS does not support encrypting and compressing the same file.</p>
<p class="indent">Disk quotas allow an administrator to set disk space thresholds for users. This gives an administrator the ability to track the amount of disk space each user is consuming and limit how much disk space each user has access to. The administrator can set a warning threshold and a deny threshold and deny access to the user once they reach the deny threshold.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev57">Resilient File System</h4>
<p class="noindent">The resilient file system (ReFS) is a proprietary file system developed by Microsoft to support the Windows operating systems. It first became available with Windows Server 2012 and is supported on Windows Server 2012 and later server operating systems as well as Windows 8.1 and later versions.</p>
<p class="indent">Rather than fully replacing NTFS, ReFS offers support for some new features by sacrificing some other features. ReFS&#8217;s new features include the following:</p>
<p class="bullt"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Integrity checking and data scrubbing</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;These features are a form of file integrity monitoring (FIM) that checks data for errors and automatically replaces corrupt data with known good data. It also computes checksums for file data and metadata.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Storage virtualization</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;Remote mounts such as SAN storage can be formatted as local storage. Additionally, mirroring can be applied to disks in a logical volume to provide redundancy and striping to provide better performance.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Tiering</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;Multiple storage types with different capacity and performance ratings can be combined together to form tiered storage.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Disk pooling</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;A single ReFS logical volume can consist of multiple storage types. Unlike RAID, the drives do not need to be the same size and type to be in a pool.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Support for longer file paths than NTFS</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;NTFS was limited to 256-character file names and file paths, but ReFS can support file names and file paths up to 32,768 characters in length each. This allows for more descriptive names and deeper folder hierarchies.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Block cloning</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;A feature that decreases the time required for virtual machine copies and snapshots.</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="none" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><img class="inline" src="../Images/image01088.jpeg" width="14" height="14" alt="Images"/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>Sparse valid data length (VDL)</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;A feature that reduces the time required for creation of thick-provisioned virtual hard disks.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_44" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>These new features, however, come at a cost. Microsoft has sacrificed some NTFS features that system administrators have become quite comfortable with including support for EFS, compression, data deduplication, and disk quotas.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev58">Virtual Machine File System</h4>
<p class="noindent">The virtual machine file system (VMFS) is VMware&#8217;s cluster file system. It is used with VMware ESXi server and vSphere and was created to store virtual machine disk images, including virtual machine snapshots. It allows for multiple servers to read and write to the file system simultaneously while keeping individual virtual machine files locked. VMFS volumes can be logically increased by spanning multiple VMFS volumes together.</p>
<h4 class="h4-a" id="ch2lev59">Z File System</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Z file system (ZFS) is a combined file system and logical volume manager designed by Sun Microsystems. The ZFS file system protects against data corruption and support for high storage capacities. ZFS also provides volume management, snapshots, and continuous integrity checking with automatic repair.</p>
<p class="indent">ZFS was created with data integrity as its primary focus. It is designed to protect the user&#8217;s data against corruption. ZFS is currently the only 128-bit file system. It uses a pooled storage method, which allows space to be used only as it is needed for data storage.</p>
