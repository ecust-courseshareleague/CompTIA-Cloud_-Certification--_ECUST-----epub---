<p class="noindent-d"><span class="dropcap">W</span>elcome to <em>CompTIA Cloud+ Certification Practice Exams</em>! This book serves as a preparation tool for the CompTIA Cloud+ certification exam (CV0-002) as well as for your work in the IT security field.</p>
<h3 class="h3a" id="introlev1">The CompTIA Cloud+ Certification Exam (Exam CV0-002)</h3>
<p class="noindent">The CompTIA Cloud+ certification exam (CV0-002) is a vendor-neutral exam that prepares candidates for configuring, managing, and supporting cloud computing environments. CompTIA recommends that exam candidates have a solid understanding of computer networking (CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Server+) and 24&#8211;36 months of IT experience related to computer networking, local and network storage technologies, or datacenter administration.</p>
<p class="indent">Because cloud computing depends on operating system virtualization, understanding hypervisors and virtualization is critical. Aside from cloud concepts such as cloud service models, candidates should also have experience deploying and managing a variety of cloud services through at least one public cloud provider. Most large cloud providers allow potential customers to sign up for a free trial account; if you haven&#8217;t actually deployed public cloud services in the past, you should consider it as part of your exam preparation.</p>
<p class="indent">Exam CV0-002 consists of five categories, otherwise called &#8220;domains.&#8221; CompTIA has assigned a percentage for each domain as it relates to the overall exam as follows:</p>
<p class="image-l"><img src="../Images/image01229.jpeg" width="630" height="200" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_xx" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Exam CV0-002 consists of multiple choice questions and performance-based questions. Multiple choice questions are designed to test your knowledge, or ability to retain information. The performance-based questions are designed to ensure you have the necessary skill to apply your knowledge to solve a business problem through cloud computing.</p>
<p class="indent">The performance-based questions may be on a single screen, or you may flip back and forth between two screens (most likely diagrams) to answer the question. Text will accompany any diagrams to guide you in solving a problem.</p>
<p class="indent">You may come across exam questions that show command-line output, performance metrics, and so on. Make sure you can interpret cloud-related performance statistics to determine where a problem might exist.</p>
<p class="indent">Watch the question wording carefully. It might seem all answer choices are correct for some questions, but the question might ask what is the FIRST, BEST, LAST, or NEXT thing that should be done&#8212;the sequence of how to perform tasks properly is important!</p>
<h3 class="h3a" id="ch1lev1">About This Book</h3>
<p class="noindent">The objective of this book is to prepare you for the CompTIA Cloud+ exam by familiarizing you with the technology and body of knowledge tested on the exam. Because the primary focus of this book is to help you pass the test, it doesn&#8217;t always cover every aspect of the related technology. Some aspects of the technology are covered only to the extent necessary to help you understand what you need to know to pass the exam, but I hope this book will serve you as a valuable professional resource after your exam as well.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>CompTIA Cloud+ Certification Practice Exams (Exam CV0-002)</em> provides a battery of practice test questions organized by chapter topic. The 14 chapters contain 500 questions that cover all the objectives for the CV0-002 exam. Additionally, the accompanying website provides access to 200 more practice questions in an online, customizable test engine that enables you to take full-length practice exams in a simulated testing environment or customized quizzes by chapter or exam domain. A separate quiz of 10 performance-based questions simulates the interactive question types you are likely to encounter in the CV0-002 exam.</p>
<p class="indent">This book was developed and written in conjunction with the <em>CompTIA Cloud+ Certification Study Guide, Second Edition (Exam CV0-002)</em>, by Scott Wilson and Eric Vanderburg. The order the objectives are presented in is identical, as are the chapter titles. <span id="page_xxi" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>The Exam Readiness Checklist included at the end of this introduction allows you to cross-reference the specific chapters and question numbers that cover each exam objective. These books were designed to work together as a comprehensive program for self-study.</p>
<h4 class="h4">In Every Chapter</h4>
<p class="noindent">This book is organized in such a way as to serve as an in-depth review for the CompTIA Cloud+ exam for both experienced IT security professionals and newcomers to security technologies.
